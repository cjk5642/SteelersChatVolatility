hrzgfga,2022-01-09 20:31:22,Browns still seem to be the browns for now. Hopefully that stays the same
hrzfuww,2022-01-09 20:27:46,NO ONE wants to see Ben with the ball in the 4th down by a score. How many times has Coach Johnny seen his ratbirds lose like this?
hrz9vnw,2022-01-09 19:50:42,"We play the games because no one knows what is going to happen - if we did, we wouldn't play the game in the first place. It's unlikely to happen...but it was also unlikely for the Jaguars to dominate the Colts today."
hrz9hx7,2022-01-09 19:48:23,Thanks. Fixed.
hrz8x32,2022-01-09 19:44:57,"Ya boi was there! Steelers fans took over that stadium. At least 30% Steelers. 

Let’s GOOOO!!!!"
hrz7cd7,2022-01-09 19:35:17,"Things are looking good, until both the Chargers and Raiders just stare at each other on the field for 60 minutes tonight."
hrz2qz7,2022-01-09 19:07:43,"Ahhhh, dang. That’s a tough sled for us. But as we’ve proven even getting to the playoffs this year, anything is possible?? Just uhh.. not always likely, but possible!"
hrz2l2h,2022-01-09 19:06:45,"Nope, Titans clinched the 1 seed and that’s the only bye in the new 7 team format."
hrz1m8f,2022-01-09 19:00:57,Oh yeah. They’re good now. Gonna be a good division to watch. Except the browns. Unless they do something
hrz12uc,2022-01-09 18:57:44,Been an injury riddled year for both teams. Especially you guys though. Gonna feel weird with Cincinnati being good now too.
hrz063t,2022-01-09 18:52:23,Fuck.....
hryzts3,2022-01-09 18:50:21,"Nah, they have a BYE I think"
hryzmlq,2022-01-09 18:49:08,"The saving grace is that they have no expectations at all. If they were expected to perform like an actual playoff team next week, Tomlin woulda been screwed"
hryzln8,2022-01-09 18:48:59,Oh hell…I don’t know if you’ve noticed…but there’s a lot of Ray Ray Hate on this sub. I don’t get it…the dude plays with heart and he’s pretty damned shifty
hryzf5l,2022-01-09 18:47:55,OK sure.. cry some more about Tomlin next week.
hryz4i7,2022-01-09 18:46:09,"maybe...maaaaayyyyybeeee the nfl corrects that stripsack..strip sack... would have been better to have the record ""cleanly"" but they can and should correct that call."
hryz2pp,2022-01-09 18:45:52,touché
hryyj15,2022-01-09 18:42:40,Boswell.
hryyi4n,2022-01-09 18:42:32,Ok we have a >99% chance of going to the playoffs
hryyh6e,2022-01-09 18:42:22,Imagine if the raiders and chargers kneel it the whole game.  As fucked up these last few years has been it’d fit right in.
hryyh2p,2022-01-09 18:42:22,All hail Trevor Lawrence for keeping the dream alive.
hryy6mv,2022-01-09 18:40:38,Okay they won!
hryy67x,2022-01-09 18:40:33,130+ bpm and I still can’t feel my fingers!
hryy433,2022-01-09 18:40:12,Bad reasoning. Calling the TO gives them a chance to talk it over on the sidelines
hryy0g8,2022-01-09 18:39:36,Thank you
hryy0c2,2022-01-09 18:39:35,Not be surprised at all.
hryxxql,2022-01-09 18:39:10,"... k,  I guess we can bring them back home after all.    But only because I'm feeling *very* generous."
hryxxee,2022-01-09 18:39:06,Raiders and chargers tie
hryxt97,2022-01-09 18:38:27,What if you wake up tomorrow and find out that the Chargers and Raiders tied? Lol
hryxry2,2022-01-09 18:38:14,Does not compute
hryxqpc,2022-01-09 18:38:02,Nah
hryxmz1,2022-01-09 18:37:26,Of course! Hopefully you caught the end!
hryxmdb,2022-01-09 18:37:20,Was wasting a down each play but it did set up his run to the outside before the field goal because they were so committed to stopping it. Super frustrating at the time but worked out in the end
hryxlvv,2022-01-09 18:37:15,I can't believe he did it one last time after that crazy game. Almost wouldn't be mad if the later game ties and the Steelers get knocked out that way.
hryxl8p,2022-01-09 18:37:09,Let’s go chargers! Because fuck the raiders!
hryxl65,2022-01-09 18:37:08,Same but to the Bills. Wtf
hryxkyn,2022-01-09 18:37:06,"Correct. If it’s a tie, both LAC and LV are in and we’re out because we’d all be 9-7-1 and we lost to both of them."
hryxkqy,2022-01-09 18:37:04,Hey everyone so is there any scenarios where we don’t play the chiefs first round?
hryxkei,2022-01-09 18:37:00,Honestly even if we go one and done he beat the Ravens at home in week 18 and that's good enough for me
hryxkas,2022-01-09 18:36:59,I think the steelers losing and jags winning was more likely. But al we can do is anxiously wait now....
hryxfr7,2022-01-09 18:36:16,Time to bury my heart and dig it up again for next week.
hryxf0a,2022-01-09 18:36:08,Fuck CBS for cutting away to the Tampa game.
hryxeuj,2022-01-09 18:36:07,Omg Big Ben you did it again one last time you mother fucker you the man I love Ben thank you you could ask for a better ending
hryxes6,2022-01-09 18:36:06,Ya baby!!! Now no ties tonight!!
hryxelq,2022-01-09 18:36:05,Right??? LET'S FUCKING GO
hryxe5a,2022-01-09 18:36:00,"Yes, the result doesn't matter as long as LA *or* Las Vegas win."
hryxdn1,2022-01-09 18:35:56,Vintage Ben.

hryxcy3,2022-01-09 18:35:49,I can breathe again 😅
hryxcsp,2022-01-09 18:35:48,But actually better to just kick it. If miss and ravens go on offense there is still a chance at a turnover.
hryx8t5,2022-01-09 18:35:12,DO WE DESERVE THE PLAYOFFS? ABSOLUTELY NOT BUT I AM CUMMING AND SHIDDING RN FUCK THE RAT BIRDS BIG BENS FINAL RIDE BAYBAY
hryx8r8,2022-01-09 18:35:11,DID YOU FORGET WE HAVE LARGE FUCKING BENJAMIN????????
hryx8q4,2022-01-09 18:35:11,Lions fan here. Super glad you guys won. Only reason Ravens were still in the hunt was because of a missed delay of game call and a league record long field goal against us earlier this year. Congrats fellas!
hryx8l7,2022-01-09 18:35:10,Thank you Jacksonville
hryx8k7,2022-01-09 18:35:09,Ha me too!😂

hryx70a,2022-01-09 18:34:54,low key waiting for the drama once raiders and chargers tie their game :D
hryx6w9,2022-01-09 18:34:53,so it doesn’t matter tonight right as log is not a tie is that the thing?

hryx5xr,2022-01-09 18:34:45,They fucking did it 😭
hryx5mn,2022-01-09 18:34:42,Canadian tv dropped coverage of this game before the kick to switch to the Bills game. Jesus Christ.
hryx5bl,2022-01-09 18:34:39,NFL channel
hryx1q0,2022-01-09 18:34:05,Now I gotta stay up until midnight

hryv0j9,2022-01-09 18:21:49,Is it weird that I’m more interested in Baltimore getting the ball back to get TJ another shot at the record than I am winning so we can get our teeth kicked in by KC or Buffalo next week?
hryv0bg,2022-01-09 18:21:46, They have been wasting a lot of time off the clock. Screws their chances of getting a 2nd possession if needed.

hryuijr,2022-01-09 18:18:43,Am I wrong to guess that it’s 4 downs from here out? A loss is as good as a tie at this point
hryuie4,2022-01-09 18:18:42,Lol maybe it speaks to my confidence in the Steelers lack of ability to score a TD
hryui6y,2022-01-09 18:18:40,I’m going to have a fucking heart attack over here man

hryufhw,2022-01-09 18:18:13,My thought exactly.
hryuf9k,2022-01-09 18:18:10,"I meant with 7 seconds left, when they kneeled down"
hryuf4f,2022-01-09 18:18:08,You know Canada is thinking “I’ll be famous if a screen wins the game”
hryubyp,2022-01-09 18:17:36,"I can’t watch any longer, I’ve done what I can

STAY HYPED FRIENDS! LFGGGGGGG"

hryuar9,2022-01-09 18:17:24,Let’s go Ben!!!
hryualn,2022-01-09 18:17:22,Defense stepping up big on that drive. Now Ben just has to do what he’s done his whole career.

hryuaez,2022-01-09 18:17:20,"Still horrible coverage from Bush, could’ve been called for PI. So stupid."
hryuabv,2022-01-09 18:17:19,As long as chargers raiders doesn’t end in a tie they’re in.

hryu369,2022-01-09 18:16:06,Honestly that’s probably the most bullshit part of this game
hryu34l,2022-01-09 18:16:06,CMON DEFENSE
hryu2y9,2022-01-09 18:16:04,I saw someone complaining about it in the thread

hrytyp5,2022-01-09 18:15:20,how the fuck are we still in the playoffhunt with this garbage fire team
hrytykt,2022-01-09 18:15:19,I don’t want to hear shit about “not living in our fears” when you took the game winning drive away from your HoF QB potentially the last time bell ever touch the ball
hrytye7,2022-01-09 18:15:17,Witherspoon if there was a time for a pick…

hrytwf5,2022-01-09 18:14:58,You know that scene in breaking bad where Walt is laughing hysterically having a mental breakdown in the crawl space? That’s me right now
hrytwan,2022-01-09 18:14:56,That was New York Giants level play calling.
hrytw7h,2022-01-09 18:14:56,Cam gonna get a penalty for making a tackle. Refs don't like that.
hrytw3x,2022-01-09 18:14:55,We need to win today! We would have an easy game against the Chiefs next weekend.
hrytvwi,2022-01-09 18:14:53,Maybe stop Murray guys?
hrytvr5,2022-01-09 18:14:51,I still can’t believe he punted.

hrytqw9,2022-01-09 18:14:01,Which fuckin dlineman just spun and fell
hrytqvj,2022-01-09 18:14:01,Defense is so soft
hrytq5c,2022-01-09 18:13:53,How can there be an entire NFL game with no holding penalties?
hrytpgh,2022-01-09 18:13:46,Last week probably
hrytpd4,2022-01-09 18:13:45,So easy for the Ravens
hrytlg7,2022-01-09 18:13:05,Ravens always win in OT
hrytl8z,2022-01-09 18:13:02,When a 4 yard run stop feels like a win...
hrytl2l,2022-01-09 18:13:00,I do not feel that way. i think statistically it's been shown that receiving is always better.
hrytkyw,2022-01-09 18:12:59,When is the last ravens hold
hrytkh5,2022-01-09 18:12:54,Yes tie.
hrytkgm,2022-01-09 18:12:54,There are no 2 OT. A tie is a tie

hrytjgo,2022-01-09 18:12:44,Why must our run defense suck so much?
hrytjc5,2022-01-09 18:12:43,It’s pretty much expected at this point

One. Last. Time."
hrytj3p,2022-01-09 18:12:40,cut fucking bush right now.

hryti4d,2022-01-09 18:12:30,If we won that lions game would this game even matter?
hrythuk,2022-01-09 18:12:28,"Wrong.  It’s on 88.  He turns up field, his momentum is not being stopped.  He isn’t a winning football player.  Two games he would have directly cost them this year."
hrytht1,2022-01-09 18:12:27,This is where TJ shines. He’s the biggest star on the field and we need him now.

hryte09,2022-01-09 18:11:50,We have our first round pick on the job!
hrytdzk,2022-01-09 18:11:50,Shot heard around the world
hrytdsr,2022-01-09 18:11:48,Because defense gets told to get slap it to the ground then they are pretty much in fg range
hrytdhm,2022-01-09 18:11:45,8 seconds is not enough time for a Hail Mary and a field goal. Not that it matters since ben wouldn’t be able to push the ball further than 10 yards anyway
hrytdey,2022-01-09 18:11:44,This is it. Steelers wanted 2nd possession because these offenses will be hard pressed to score a TD
hrytddv,2022-01-09 18:11:44,Our run defense is just embarrassing
hrytdd3,2022-01-09 18:11:44,I’m gonna throw up
hrytdcx,2022-01-09 18:11:43,That’s just true lmao
hrytdak,2022-01-09 18:11:43,Defense please
hrytd97,2022-01-09 18:11:42,I like the cut of your jib.
hrytd5s,2022-01-09 18:11:41,Where is Troy Polamalu at we need a splash play ASAP
hrytd5d,2022-01-09 18:11:41,"Yep, this is still a regular season game"
hrytd46,2022-01-09 18:11:41,They are going to run it down our throats aren’t they?
hrytd2s,2022-01-09 18:11:41,Neither teams go to the playoffs
hrytcwy,2022-01-09 18:11:39,The Steelers punting on their 44 was always the correct call. Justin Tucker is on the other side.
hrytcte,2022-01-09 18:11:38,PLEASE PLEASE PLEEEEEEEASE
hrytcr1,2022-01-09 18:11:37,I need a strip sack plz. I need a turnover stat.

hryt86w,2022-01-09 18:10:51,Highly unlikely? Have you watched this game? I'd wager that's the most likely outcome...
hryt85h,2022-01-09 18:10:51,Because an interception with fat non-tacklers on the field and your fastest guys behind the ball is your worst nightmare. Especially without any tall WRs other than Claypool.
hryt84r,2022-01-09 18:10:51,I prefer the ravens getting it tbh

hryt5ob,2022-01-09 18:10:26,We need yet another turnover TBH. Defense has given everything but we still need more.

hryt5fk,2022-01-09 18:10:23,We had that already and our receivers don’t understand what getting past the first down means
hryt5dy,2022-01-09 18:10:23,Our defense was just out there. Wish they had more of a break before going out again.

hryt1qd,2022-01-09 18:09:47,I think we should’ve gone for it on 4th and inches but a kneel at the end was the right move
hryt1ph,2022-01-09 18:09:47,It's always tails Ben. Always! Just ask Jerome.
hryt1of,2022-01-09 18:09:47,Seems like we never do.

hryt1kr,2022-01-09 18:09:46,7 seconds... they couldn't try to chuck it for a few yards and at least attempt a half field fg?

hryt13t,2022-01-09 18:09:41,I get the 4th and 1 punt to a degree but why not arm punt one to Chase? Knowing how much PI gets called these days.
hryt0yt,2022-01-09 18:09:40,I know it’s highly unlikely…but what if this game is a tie?
hryt0x2,2022-01-09 18:09:39,"well I trust the d, and I’d rather this than do nothing on offense first and set up tucker for the win"
hryt0vm,2022-01-09 18:09:39,Steelers lose on tiebreaker to Colts and the Steelers are out.

hryt0a5,2022-01-09 18:09:33,What would happen if THIS game ended in a tie?
hryt062,2022-01-09 18:09:32,"I understand the logic.  I also understand getting the yard and going down and winning the fucking game.  We used to be the aggressive Steelers, we are now the passive aggressive Steelers."
hryt05e,2022-01-09 18:09:32,Ravens get the ball…we’re out
hryt02r,2022-01-09 18:09:31,We are out if we tie. We need to win to have a better record than the Colts.
hryt005,2022-01-09 18:09:30,Alright. Need the Defense to come up huge here. Please Minkah or TJ make a HUGE play to end this game on their side of the field. Please. This would be the biggest birthday tease ever if we lose or tie.
hryszx4,2022-01-09 18:09:30,Of course we didn’t win the toss

hryszm8,2022-01-09 18:09:27,More likely to throw a pick 6 then a 80 yard td
hrysziv,2022-01-09 18:09:26,I am sick to my stomach
hryszfr,2022-01-09 18:09:25,Of course our playoff date decided in OT. Pouring out my finest single malt bleach

hrypuo4,2022-01-09 17:51:08,"There's gonna be a long DPI call on this drive, isn't there?"
hrypulj,2022-01-09 17:51:07,TJ breaking the record on this drive and sealing the game would be great.
hrypuhz,2022-01-09 17:51:06,Get this person a new pair of pants and underwear let's goooo
hrypuht,2022-01-09 17:51:06,Of course they attack Bush...

hrypod2,2022-01-09 17:50:09,Now a team that doesn’t pass protect well with a rookie QB has to drive by throwing...
hrypo8q,2022-01-09 17:50:08,"Of course, no block in back on obvious play"

Ben: “I didn’t hear no bell”"
hrypnz3,2022-01-09 17:50:05,"If they went for two and didn't make it, then Tucker would win the game for them. Going for one was the right choice."
hrypntj,2022-01-09 17:50:04,You have a heart rate?
hrypns9,2022-01-09 17:50:03,Break the record and seal the game in one play
hrypnn2,2022-01-09 17:50:02,Anyone else relieved we didn't go for two trying to make it a four point game?
hrypnmz,2022-01-09 17:50:02,"Who thinks TJ is going to get a sack to break the record, win us the game, and get us into the playoffs all at the same time!?"

hrypib0,2022-01-09 17:49:11,Eat your heart out Baltimore #7 somehow did it again
hrypi99,2022-01-09 17:49:10,"Ah yes, instead of going for two, just allow them to be able to tie it with a field goal because it’s not like they have THE BEST FUCKING KICKER IN HISTORY on the other team, great choice"

hryphci,2022-01-09 17:49:01,"I have never heard a crowd boo the opposing team like that for scoring, oh this must sting"
hryphce,2022-01-09 17:49:01,If watt gets the record and we hold them i may have a heart attack

hryoy4g,2022-01-09 17:45:54,We need this drive to take forever and end in a TD. Give Baltimore no choice but to pass and give TJ the chance to own the record.

hryopg3,2022-01-09 17:44:29,"Ouch, that shot to the head"
hryopf6,2022-01-09 17:44:28,Ray-Ray McCloud has quietly made some big plays this season.
hryopdn,2022-01-09 17:44:28,No helmet to helmet? These refs man. One penalty for 5 yards called all day on the Ravens.
hryop6s,2022-01-09 17:44:26,HOW WAS THERE NO FLAG
hryop6h,2022-01-09 17:44:26,Actually ray ray has played good today

hryoo8q,2022-01-09 17:44:17,yeah he’s a great returner and a solid receiver forced into juju’s role and done decently
hryoo6m,2022-01-09 17:44:17,RAY RAY CAUGHT ONE!
hryonvu,2022-01-09 17:44:14,I keep thinking 'no way do I want to see them in a playoff game' but my body can't help but root for them to win and sneak in
hryontt,2022-01-09 17:44:13,No more running
hryonlh,2022-01-09 17:44:11,Flag hit him right in the head
hryonjh,2022-01-09 17:44:11,Lol where’s that guy that just said he’d be fine with RayRay just being the returner
hryonj6,2022-01-09 17:44:11,Like I said. Let’s get a TD and then Watt gets the record!!
hryonak,2022-01-09 17:44:08,That should’ve been 15
hryokhz,2022-01-09 17:43:40,no idea how that hit isn’t a penalty
hryokhf,2022-01-09 17:43:40,40th time is the charm when it comes to throwing it to ray ray
hryokfw,2022-01-09 17:43:40,McCloud! Are you good? Are you shit? Wtf are you.
hryokcb,2022-01-09 17:43:39,Helmet to helmet? Nah of course not

hryojj0,2022-01-09 17:43:31,Helmet to helmet!
hryojea,2022-01-09 17:43:30,WAIT WHAT
hryoizd,2022-01-09 17:43:25,Finally forcing it to McCloud actually worked lol
hryoith,2022-01-09 17:43:24,thank FUCK now RUN THE BALL
hryoisb,2022-01-09 17:43:23,Every offensive lineman would be cut after this season maybe save for 2. Moore and Greene.
hryoio1,2022-01-09 17:43:22,RAY RAY
hryoief,2022-01-09 17:43:19,Is our OLine THAT bad? Right off the snap it’s like instant pressure. That one dude got bench pressed to the ground
hryoibi,2022-01-09 17:43:19,Omg RAY RAY
hryoi9n,2022-01-09 17:43:18,This makeshift line is fucking us
hryoi8a,2022-01-09 17:43:18,To stop substitutions
hryoi6o,2022-01-09 17:43:17,People need to stop bitching about McCloud
hryoi6c,2022-01-09 17:43:17,Can’t build any momentum
hryoi3a,2022-01-09 17:43:16,HOW ISNT THAT A FLAG
hryoi0v,2022-01-09 17:43:16,Leglue is getting blown up. He fucked us this drive. Haeg the last drive. WTF.
hryoi01,2022-01-09 17:43:15,This O-Line is selling holy fuck
hryohwi,2022-01-09 17:43:15,The oline is such ass
hryoho3,2022-01-09 17:43:12,These penalties are chapping my ass!!
hryohmr,2022-01-09 17:43:12,oline kills the game
hryohkj,2022-01-09 17:43:11,fuckin sniffing leglue
hryohkb,2022-01-09 17:43:11,just make Canada illegal.
hryohbm,2022-01-09 17:43:09,He’s working for Frank Reich
hryoh90,2022-01-09 17:43:08,I eat ass
hryoh83,2022-01-09 17:43:08,Holy fuck this team
hryoh0w,2022-01-09 17:43:06,I’ve mentally prepared for the L so if we win I’ll just be happy and if we lose it’ll just be the most Steelers way not to make the playoffs.
hryoh0k,2022-01-09 17:43:06,He just led them to a 13 and 3 season like 3 years ago lol
hryogz9,2022-01-09 17:43:06,Leglue blown up
hryogwp,2022-01-09 17:43:05,Cut the whole offensive line in the offseason
hryoedl,2022-01-09 17:42:40,Umm which one of our oline got destroyed on that play?
hryoe7n,2022-01-09 17:42:39,Here we go with burning timeouts in a close game. Is there anything more fitting for Ben and Tomlins last game together?
hryoe79,2022-01-09 17:42:38,"For reals lol. Take your pick on the only defense Tomlin defenders have, no losing seasons or it’s not his fault"
hryodn3,2022-01-09 17:42:33,"Sucks having to use a TO there, but the drive is dead at 2nd & 17 so you gotta do it"
hryodm5,2022-01-09 17:42:33,This team is a mess.
hryodb2,2022-01-09 17:42:29,This offense fckn kills me
hryodaq,2022-01-09 17:42:29,3rd and 4. 4 down. I like the run here
hryodai,2022-01-09 17:42:29,Let 7 call it
hryod87,2022-01-09 17:42:29,This offensive line…
hryod3k,2022-01-09 17:42:27,Teams only get charged a timeout for injury in the final 2 minutes of the halfs
hryoczd,2022-01-09 17:42:26,Bullshit
hryocta,2022-01-09 17:42:24,Feel like the timeout is worth more than the yards. Why don't teams just eat the yards and save the very important timeout.
hryochv,2022-01-09 17:42:21,"Can't even adapt and change play calling, don't deserve playoffs"
hryocfb,2022-01-09 17:42:20,how is ben not calling the plays yet
hryoc01,2022-01-09 17:42:16,That penalty would have killed us.
hryobyw,2022-01-09 17:42:16,The bosses have to be watching this. Hope Canada is fired to the fucking sun.
hryoby9,2022-01-09 17:42:16,Maybe throwing a screen to waste a down is part of Canada’s strategy
hryobsy,2022-01-09 17:42:14,"For anyone saying it was a waste of a timeout, the center couldn’t hear and wasn’t joking the ball

Would’ve been 2nd and 17 from delay of game"
hryobo0,2022-01-09 17:42:13,How do we lose 2 yards on 1st down from passing
hryob9z,2022-01-09 17:42:10,No flow to this offense at all
hryob0u,2022-01-09 17:42:07,Ain’t over yet
hryo7bo,2022-01-09 17:41:31,"Don’t be… as fans? We can’t lose. If we lose the game…we get a better draft pick. If we win the game, we got one more week(at least) of Steelers football."
hryo771,2022-01-09 17:41:30,Better than backwards as far as DJ goes.
hryo76g,2022-01-09 17:41:30,[deleted]
hryo71b,2022-01-09 17:41:28,This team just does not want to make the playoffs I swear
hryo6v8,2022-01-09 17:41:27,Is Diontae scared of getting tackled? He runs backwards or falls to the ground every reception
hryo6p7,2022-01-09 17:41:25,Screens need to be banned for the Steelers
hryo6jg,2022-01-09 17:41:23,Stop. The. Fucking. Screens.
hryo6eo,2022-01-09 17:41:22,Most plays for negative yards
hryo6at,2022-01-09 17:41:21,Canada gonna try to win this game on 4 field goals 12-10.

hryo61w,2022-01-09 17:41:18,Claypool seems like such a douche bag lol
hryo5ta,2022-01-09 17:41:16,Hate losing the TO there
hryo5jb,2022-01-09 17:41:13,"Stop throwing east/west, holy shit man"
hryo5hg,2022-01-09 17:41:13,What a wasted fucking timeout.
hryo5aj,2022-01-09 17:41:11,12 seconds when he went under center. Hasssenaur has to fucking be aware of the fucking situation!
hryo5af,2022-01-09 17:41:11,Soooooo are they just not charging Baltimore a timeout for that injury? What the fuck?
hryo55k,2022-01-09 17:41:10,We have to go upfield man these screens are getting pressed
hryo549,2022-01-09 17:41:09,Ok are we going to win this or not?
hryo4y6,2022-01-09 17:41:08,whyyyy do they think behind the line passes will go anywhere

hryo46f,2022-01-09 17:41:00,The Lions are trying harder to beat the Packers than we are the Ravens. The Jags are beating the Colts. We’re sucking.
hryo3yb,2022-01-09 17:40:58,Yeah quite good awareness
hryo3xz,2022-01-09 17:40:58,I have never hated an offense more than this one
hryo3mx,2022-01-09 17:40:55,Cause he's hurt
hryo3iu,2022-01-09 17:40:54,"Fuck screens fr, they literally never ever work for us"
hryo05x,2022-01-09 17:40:22,Damn check downs
hryo05f,2022-01-09 17:40:22,Muth really failed blocking that screen
hryo02c,2022-01-09 17:40:21,Kill Matt Canada mid game and let Ben call the plays please
hrynzz8,2022-01-09 17:40:20,"That was good of Claypool, realizing he needs 2 and just cutting it up field."
hrynzjf,2022-01-09 17:40:16,Ball below his waist and behind his momentum. If the ball is chest high and leading him he can turn up the sideline for a few yards.
hrynzgy,2022-01-09 17:40:15,Stop running backwards
hrynz2n,2022-01-09 17:40:11,Why isnt najee getting more carries?

hrynyxm,2022-01-09 17:40:10,"Chase ""RB1"" Claypool"
hrynyuv,2022-01-09 17:40:10,We have to stop throwing behind the line

hrynybg,2022-01-09 17:40:04,Whoops
hrynxv2,2022-01-09 17:40:00,Friermuth is awesome and even Gentry can play. So dumb we don’t utilize them
hrynxip,2022-01-09 17:39:56,Smart play by Claypool
hrynxe0,2022-01-09 17:39:55,Can Claypool not get open downfield?
hrynxcm,2022-01-09 17:39:55,"The announcers keep talking about how this feels like a old AFC North game. Couldn’t disagree more. I think they’re just saying that because it’s low scoring? Lol. This feels like two anemic offenses, not two good defenses. Old AFC North rivalry to me is two powerhouses smashing each other."
hrynwuy,2022-01-09 17:39:50,I wouldn't even be mad at that

hrynk6j,2022-01-09 17:37:51,Despite giving up 200 yards rushing the defense is more than holding up their end of the deal. This offense should honestly be embarrassed.

hryniyk,2022-01-09 17:37:39,"I keep on seeing bad snaps from Green. 

We don't need them to be perfect, but please just don't let any get over Ben's head.

Edit: My bad it's Hassenauer, not Green. Still the snaps haven't been great"
hryniut,2022-01-09 17:37:38,Following the game on here while cleaning. Saves me slightly less frustration & I actually get stuff done.
hrynit7,2022-01-09 17:37:37,Ive never seen so many injuries in a game. Jesus
hryninz,2022-01-09 17:37:36,All I know is that the coach’s see something in him that isn’t quite coming out in games just yet.
hrynih9,2022-01-09 17:37:34,"Come on, Ben. One more time!"
hrynign,2022-01-09 17:37:33,Big Ben final tour szn will continue
hrynf4u,2022-01-09 17:37:01,I'm glad they showed the replay and the correct spot.
hrynes0,2022-01-09 17:36:57,OOOHHHH MAMA
hryneg0,2022-01-09 17:36:54,At least we don’t have Carson Wentz
hrynea0,2022-01-09 17:36:52,Thank you CBS for acknowledging your bias and correcting yourselves.
hryndp0,2022-01-09 17:36:46,"Come, TD time"
hryndmt,2022-01-09 17:36:46,I could use a late Santonio Holmes TD in BAL right about now.
hrynd9p,2022-01-09 17:36:42,Time for a Flacco special please.
hrynd3r,2022-01-09 17:36:40,"Offense is more like a Nikola, that EV car that literally can only roll downhill with gravity."
hryncu3,2022-01-09 17:36:38,STAT YO MOMMA.
hryncu1,2022-01-09 17:36:38,I was expecting for the Colts to be up 20 at this point so my heart wouldn't have to be crushed by a possible Steelers loss. But this turn of events has me dreading the fact that Jacksonville might just take care of business and we won't.
hryncn4,2022-01-09 17:36:36,Fairy tale ending please…
hryncek,2022-01-09 17:36:33,God bless you guys. Our guys struggling. Y’all warriors
hryncee,2022-01-09 17:36:33,"I am more confident that Bush will be better in 2022 and that will make Schobert better…plus we have Buddy Johnson learning his craft.

On the DL? We have Cam…he is the only sure thing. We don’t know if Tuitt will ever play again, we don’t know if Alualu will be the same player he was before the ACL…and all we have castoffs and later round draft picks to make up the difference."
hrynccz,2022-01-09 17:36:33,It starts in the basement apparently
hryncci,2022-01-09 17:36:33,"Honestly, they can lose 60-0 to KC. I just want them to make the playoffs"
hryncan,2022-01-09 17:36:32,"OH Mama, here we go Boys! Take my energy Ben!"
hrync7y,2022-01-09 17:36:31,8 minutes to save our season
hrync4s,2022-01-09 17:36:31,The Thought of that makes me hard
hrync3l,2022-01-09 17:36:30,I just don’t feel that they want it
hrynbwj,2022-01-09 17:36:28,Yeah isn't he leading the league in return yards? Questionable WR at times but you can't doubt his return ability.
hrynbvt,2022-01-09 17:36:28,[deleted]
hryn90j,2022-01-09 17:36:00,So you're saying there's a chance??
hryn8rh,2022-01-09 17:35:58,It’s hilarious how they keep trying to force feed ray ray mccloud the ball. They seem to think he’s a Tavon Austin/ tyreek hill type of player when he’s not
hryn8r5,2022-01-09 17:35:58,Colts just failed 4th and long
hryn8p5,2022-01-09 17:35:57,All we need to do is throw to Diontae
hryn8jb,2022-01-09 17:35:55,RENEGADE
hryn8bl,2022-01-09 17:35:53,Season is in Ben’s hands. Seems appropriate
hryn84z,2022-01-09 17:35:51,That would be good at this point.
hryn80a,2022-01-09 17:35:50,[deleted]
hryn7wm,2022-01-09 17:35:49,Feels a lot like 2019.
hryn7ry,2022-01-09 17:35:48,Ben needs to DIG FUCKIN DEEP and find his old self for ONE FUCKING DRIVE FROM THE 50
hryn7nd,2022-01-09 17:35:47,Go score a TD and then TJ gets his record.
hryn7j4,2022-01-09 17:35:46,RENEGADE STRIKES AGAIN !
hryn7hr,2022-01-09 17:35:45,I think they do they just aren’t good man
hryn7br,2022-01-09 17:35:44,With our oline  more like it.
hryn785,2022-01-09 17:35:43,The canton game was a fever dream for Harvin
hryn778,2022-01-09 17:35:43,"With how many times the defense has given the offense the ball around midfield, doing the bare minimum we should at least have 4-5 fields goals."
hryn73h,2022-01-09 17:35:42,He must have stepped out of bounds or something
hryn72r,2022-01-09 17:35:42,"If we lose, can TJ just break the sack record?"
hryn72o,2022-01-09 17:35:41,Maybe RayRays best game as a returner this year.  To bad the offense is just soooooo bad.
hryn71w,2022-01-09 17:35:41,Just one touchdown
hryn6se,2022-01-09 17:35:39,Yeah the spotters who are supposed to yank dudes who are concussed are fucking that one up. He hasn’t been the same since he knocked himself out on that blitz earlier in the game.
hryn6pm,2022-01-09 17:35:38,It just shows how good their o-line is blocking the run. Basically every RB who played for the Ravens the last couple of years balled out. That's their system.
hryn6ne,2022-01-09 17:35:37,Ray ray been impressing me lately. I feel like I was critical on him early in the year but saw someone here say something about him statistically not playing bad and since I saw that I feel like he's been playing great as a returner
hryn6gt,2022-01-09 17:35:36,And to think people sucked ryan Switzers dick.
hryn6eu,2022-01-09 17:35:35,Come on Ben. One more time.
hryn6dw,2022-01-09 17:35:35,one more 4th quarter comeback for ben
hryn6du,2022-01-09 17:35:35,Ray-ray is solid on returns but their insistence on using him as WR1 makes me want him off the damn team lol
hryn69j,2022-01-09 17:35:33,Fuckem
hryn67j,2022-01-09 17:35:33,RENEGADE IN CHAT FOR BEN
hryn64c,2022-01-09 17:35:32,Someone tell Ben his legacy is on the line here
hryn616,2022-01-09 17:35:31,Here’s your chance
hryn5vm,2022-01-09 17:35:30,We win with a walkoff sack and tj gets the record
hryn5u7,2022-01-09 17:35:29,He hurt his sack on that last sack
hryn5qm,2022-01-09 17:35:28,This may be the last drive we get
hryn5ig,2022-01-09 17:35:26,It’s Ben Time.
hryn2pb,2022-01-09 17:35:00,WE ARE BLACK AND GOLD!!! LETS GOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
hryn2ma,2022-01-09 17:34:59,Happy Cake day!
hryn2fr,2022-01-09 17:34:57,[deleted]
hryn2by,2022-01-09 17:34:56,"I would say I am hopeful that Ray Ray got it to the mid field, but with this offense, I can't be."
hryn293,2022-01-09 17:34:55,Ray Ray about time
hryn27b,2022-01-09 17:34:55,Everything is set up for Ben. Lets get it!
hryn26g,2022-01-09 17:34:55,Sadly  I thought Jacksonville was going to be the weak link in the Playoff hunt... not us... sigh.
hryn21h,2022-01-09 17:34:53,One good thing is that ray ray learned to just run forward instead of side to side
hryn21f,2022-01-09 17:34:53,SO CLOSE MCCLOUD FUCK
hryn207,2022-01-09 17:34:53,Ray ray you sonnofabitch you did it
hryn1ys,2022-01-09 17:34:53,Ray Ray returning punts? Is it happening?
hryn1ym,2022-01-09 17:34:53,Maybe the best D all season and my god we need every bit of it
hryn1xy,2022-01-09 17:34:53,We got lucky with that
hryn1uk,2022-01-09 17:34:52,"Ben this is your CAREER, let's see a vintage Ben game winner."
hryn1u6,2022-01-09 17:34:52,Offense plz
hryn1r0,2022-01-09 17:34:51,This is our chance right here!
hryn1jk,2022-01-09 17:34:49,Is that the short field we need?? Ray Ray is fun as a pr. Not as much as a wr though...
hryn1ey,2022-01-09 17:34:48,"Okay offense, let's make some magic happen by running a bunch of time off the clock and putting 7 on the board."
hryn1a8,2022-01-09 17:34:46,"We can do this, we can do this, we can do this!!"
hryn195,2022-01-09 17:34:46,Colts try 4th and 12. They fail
hryn17z,2022-01-09 17:34:46,All we need to do is win and we’re in.
hryn16t,2022-01-09 17:34:45,"If the offense can’t do anything with good field position (yet again), it’s over."
hryn10x,2022-01-09 17:34:44,Pls don’t waste the field position again 🤞🤞
hryn0za,2022-01-09 17:34:43,Lmao. No flag? Refs musta had a moment.
hryn0xz,2022-01-09 17:34:43,Do not run the ball on first down for the love of god. Everyone can see it coming
hryn0px,2022-01-09 17:34:41,DON'T RUN THE BALL NOW
hryn0pv,2022-01-09 17:34:41,WE KEEP GETTING CHANCES LET’S CAPITALIZE ON ONE FOR ONCE!!
hryn0ph,2022-01-09 17:34:40,Defense comes through for the 1000th time
hryn0l3,2022-01-09 17:34:39,Please offense. PLEASE
hryn0ib,2022-01-09 17:34:39,Now can the offense actually cook up a TD drive? Or will Canada do the two failed runs up the middle and failed screen behind the sticks?
hryn0fc,2022-01-09 17:34:38,3 and out anyone?
hryn08q,2022-01-09 17:34:36,[deleted]
hryn05u,2022-01-09 17:34:36,Dude McCloud is a great returner
hrymztj,2022-01-09 17:34:32,If you get there you deserve it.
hrymzsw,2022-01-09 17:34:32,It probably has more to do with the 14 team playoff format.
hrymzl1,2022-01-09 17:34:30,Where is TJ
hrymzbp,2022-01-09 17:34:28,Wow ray ray looked good
hrymz3i,2022-01-09 17:34:26,Play of the year for ray ray!!!
hrymz23,2022-01-09 17:34:25,Most likely.  Pick 6 or blocked punt for td
hrymyy1,2022-01-09 17:34:24,"Straight up tho, Ray Ray is killing it on returns today."
hrymyxd,2022-01-09 17:34:24,Murray had a first down. Oof refs.
hrymw31,2022-01-09 17:33:57,OH MAMA
hrymvwc,2022-01-09 17:33:55,I know I just wanna win man we need this
hrymvvj,2022-01-09 17:33:55,Thank you defense!!!
hrymva2,2022-01-09 17:33:50,I can’t believe this team still has a playoff shot. It must be the worst afc ever.
hrymutl,2022-01-09 17:33:45,"Ever since sports betting became legal everywhere, the games have been influenced even more by refs."
hrymusx,2022-01-09 17:33:45,"I wanted Ben to go out with a W, but they are not deserving that wildcard spot."
hrymuob,2022-01-09 17:33:44,Should we talk about how many players the ravens are missing? They’re literally missing hell of a lot more players than us lol
hrymujn,2022-01-09 17:33:43,Defense forced 3 TOs in this game and the offense has produced 3 points off of them. Ugh.
hrymucq,2022-01-09 17:33:41,Big stop by the defense.
hrymua8,2022-01-09 17:33:40,"Holy cow, that spot helped us."
hrymu9v,2022-01-09 17:33:40,Wow that must have been a really bad spot if they thought Murray was 2 yards short
hrymu5e,2022-01-09 17:33:39,"If the stars align to allow us into the playoffs, but we can’t win our game, we simply don’t deserve it"
hrymu52,2022-01-09 17:33:39,"Right? 

If you aren't going to support this team when it's only 10-6 in the third, then don't come to game threads. 

Seriously the worst fanbase in football, no wonder people hate us. Just constant whining."
hrymtzg,2022-01-09 17:33:37,YAY GOOD SHIT PITT D
hrymtwe,2022-01-09 17:33:36,Even if he could make deep passes the offensive line can’t buy him enough time.
hrymtnx,2022-01-09 17:33:34,"You wanna enjoy it, I just want a win"
hrymtmr,2022-01-09 17:33:33,"Ravens game plan: run against the worst run d in the league 

Steelers: run against the worst pad defense in the league. 

The score really shows who was right."
hrymtdm,2022-01-09 17:33:31,I'd call a timeout just to smack some helmets. GET FRICKING AMPED!!
hrymt47,2022-01-09 17:33:28,Lucky spot for us holy shit
hrymoad,2022-01-09 17:32:41,There were 8 guys in coverage and we were at the 50 there is no reason for an unnecessary interception. Unless harvin kicks it backwards just punt it. Shouldn’t even be having the conversation but ofc the penalty on the lineman Fucks the drive
hrymoa4,2022-01-09 17:32:41,Am I supposed to believe the Ravens haven’t held once today?
hrymo90,2022-01-09 17:32:41,Whose defense?  They've given up 180 rush yards so far
hrymo2i,2022-01-09 17:32:39,"Who knew ""win"" would be the biggest obstacle.."
hrymnn5,2022-01-09 17:32:35,Need a big turnover here from the D!
hrymnlz,2022-01-09 17:32:35,Right.  Definitely.
hrymnis,2022-01-09 17:32:34,"It was more realistic that the Jags would win their game over us winning this one, and that's absolutely shameful."
hrymn3g,2022-01-09 17:32:30,Praying for Minkah pick six. He is due.
hrymn0s,2022-01-09 17:32:29,Come on D only you can win this game for us
hrymmzr,2022-01-09 17:32:28,The defense is making Murray look like Derrick Henry
hrymmle,2022-01-09 17:32:24,"I’d die laughing we win, jags win then chargers n Raiders unknowingly do a deal to tie to both get in."
hrymmcw,2022-01-09 17:32:22,You cannot tell me Juju wouldn’t have made a difference in this game.
hrymm7g,2022-01-09 17:32:21,Why not throw a long sideline shot to Claypool and *maybe* get a completion or PI?
hrymm3v,2022-01-09 17:32:20,He has a lot left in the tank tho /s
hrymlyh,2022-01-09 17:32:18, 9 yard run on cue
hrymlya,2022-01-09 17:32:18,How are they not calling the holds against the Ravens?!
hrymlnh,2022-01-09 17:32:15,Poverty Franchise
hrymlae,2022-01-09 17:32:11,"Watch we pull out the win, Jax wins-and NO ties. 😆"
hrymijm,2022-01-09 17:31:45,"He has no Jukes and won’t take a hit. Thinks he’s bell running to the line and stopping. Never lowers his shoulder and I’ve never seen someone who gets a play blown dead from being stood up so often. 

Sorry I’m just frustrated"
hrymi4o,2022-01-09 17:31:40,He's retiring...
hrymi4e,2022-01-09 17:31:40,This team is set to self destruct in 9:30
hrymhq0,2022-01-09 17:31:36,"Need defensive td here. Not really sure why I even want to make the playoffs, but want to beat ravens lol"
hrymhhc,2022-01-09 17:31:34,Any time TJ Watt is off the field it's a win for the Ravens Offense.
hrymhg2,2022-01-09 17:31:34,I’d take that over a pick. You throw that ball up when it’s 8 guys in coverage there’s no telling what happens. We only had 3 receivers on the field
hrymheo,2022-01-09 17:31:33,Defense has forced 3 turnovers & it's only resulted in one field goal.
hrymha0,2022-01-09 17:31:32,Derailed from a damn penalty. Thanks Haeg. Jaysus.
hrymh53,2022-01-09 17:31:30,"With the only exceptions of Najee and TJ, I hate everyone on this team under the age of 30"
hrymh4x,2022-01-09 17:31:30,Need a Cam Heyward pick 6 here. That’s the only way we are scoring.
hrymgh3,2022-01-09 17:31:24,How did this same O Line look decent last week?
hrymg8n,2022-01-09 17:31:22,"Watching Jacksonville kick ass side by side with the Steelers struggling to get into field goal range is just fucking painful.

One team looks like they are playing for the playoffs and the other looks like they wanna go home to start the offseason."
hrymfk8,2022-01-09 17:31:16,Bush
hrymfhe,2022-01-09 17:31:15,"That facemask penalty was so huge. That drive was working before that play.

&#x200B;

Defense needs a pick-six or sack strip TD or something."
hrymfe9,2022-01-09 17:31:14,They could call face-mask on O-Line every fucking play against TJ Watt - That’s some fucking bullshit
hrymfbg,2022-01-09 17:31:13,We should just punt on 3rd down. Seriously.
hrymf9q,2022-01-09 17:31:13,"Something is wrong with Presley Harvin III.  I don't know if it's an injury or the yips, but he's gone from mediocre to horrible."
hrymf3o,2022-01-09 17:31:11,Yup
hrymf29,2022-01-09 17:31:11,"New qb, New O line, New O coordinator all needed"
hrymf1c,2022-01-09 17:31:11,The o line is so bad it hurts. These tackles are getting burned every single play.
hrymeyh,2022-01-09 17:31:10,"Well, we need defense to score since offense can't do shit."
hrymetu,2022-01-09 17:31:09,Why would they? Our defense sucks
hrymesm,2022-01-09 17:31:08,Been a couple of questionable play calls but For a team that has a chance at the playoffs nobody’s looks like they give a shit. It looks like a preseason game
hrymcly,2022-01-09 17:30:46,i just tuned in. fuck and thats what they do?
hrymcen,2022-01-09 17:30:44,Maybe just for field position for the punt
hrymcc1,2022-01-09 17:30:44,And we will go 4 and out
hrymcah,2022-01-09 17:30:43,They had 8 guys 20 yards off the ball. What are you talking about?
hrymc6m,2022-01-09 17:30:42,Then run away from your only downfield blocker
hrymc3i,2022-01-09 17:30:41,This game was never going to be won without the defense scoring points.
hrymc04,2022-01-09 17:30:40,Chances of bmore throwing the ball even once more?
hrymbw2,2022-01-09 17:30:39,I don’t know if they have anymore left in them. They’ve already given the offense two.
hrymbu7,2022-01-09 17:30:39,They are going to run up the middle.
hrymbsh,2022-01-09 17:30:38,how the fuck do you commit a facemask in that situation?????? again fuck this team. And of course the refs call it regardless even tho it was barley a facemask. Ravens got saved 3 times this game.
hrymbm3,2022-01-09 17:30:36,That was a bullshit penalty
hrymbcq,2022-01-09 17:30:34,Don’t worry boys. We got this
hrymb61,2022-01-09 17:30:32,We need our D to score a touchdown if we’re to win this game.
hrymax5,2022-01-09 17:30:30,"Yeah, a lot of penalties are way more severe to the offense than they are to the defense"
hrymarj,2022-01-09 17:30:28,People acting like the Ravens are not complete dog shit on defense.  Roethlisberger IS the problem.  Defense knows they only need to cover 10 yards out. Bench his selfish ass! Should of retired!
hrymapc,2022-01-09 17:30:28,I’ll enjoy watching the ravens get fucking annihilated in the playoffs
hrymak7,2022-01-09 17:30:26,Why would you throw an arm punt on 3rd and 25?
hrymadg,2022-01-09 17:30:24,The entire defense was down the field that’s all they could do
hryma86,2022-01-09 17:30:23,1 penalty for 5 yards on the ravens all game...
hryma2c,2022-01-09 17:30:22,Do we really want to see this offence in the play offs?!
hrym9w8,2022-01-09 17:30:20,"Jesus, do we even want to win this game? what the fuck."
hrym9vd,2022-01-09 17:30:20,Fucking Linemen fucking it up. Always something. Do it again D!
hrym9ro,2022-01-09 17:30:19,Come on minkah pick six
hrym9kf,2022-01-09 17:30:17,[deleted]
hrym996,2022-01-09 17:30:14,:(
hrym91c,2022-01-09 17:30:12,should've just tried the flacco special on that 3rd down ... 7 yard slants needing 25 aren't the way
hrym8z3,2022-01-09 17:30:11,D just score the fucking TD we need. This is bullshit
hrym8vn,2022-01-09 17:30:10,My opinion is that if he didn't make that facemask the play wouldn't have come off. Ben would been sacked.
hrym63k,2022-01-09 17:29:43,Face mask call was like a sledgehammer to the kneecaps. Absolutely devastating.
hrym62r,2022-01-09 17:29:43,TJ sack scoop and score.
hrym62d,2022-01-09 17:29:43,Are we really complaining about that play call ? Do you just want them to throw it up into coverage ? Y’all seen the defense they were running
hrym5zq,2022-01-09 17:29:42,"For ass as the offense has been, this game would be a lot more different if the punter could actually flip the field."
hrym5wu,2022-01-09 17:29:42,We lost
hrym5qx,2022-01-09 17:29:40,Flag on that ol hag
hrym5eq,2022-01-09 17:29:37,Hurts seeing the Jags do everything they need to do everytime they show that game. Let's get this W
hrym5aa,2022-01-09 17:29:36,"WHY ARE YOU CHECKING DOWN ON 3RD AND 25


WHY"
hrym56p,2022-01-09 17:29:35,"It isn't Haeg's fault, this offense has been terrible all day"
hrym51b,2022-01-09 17:29:33,Nah fuck the guy that grabs a face mask.
hrym518,2022-01-09 17:29:33,"Welcome to the NFL, where the refs are more inconsistent than we are."
hrym4vy,2022-01-09 17:29:32,4 turnovers
hrym4qd,2022-01-09 17:29:31,"After that INT and with that best drive of the game, without that penalty, I think they score the go-ahead. O-line costs them again"
hrym4jo,2022-01-09 17:29:29,Two offensive drives we had momentum and got fucked.
hrym4iy,2022-01-09 17:29:29,"Yep.  They have been letting them play all game, until now.  Bullshit.  They called 0 holds on Watt."
hrym4ge,2022-01-09 17:29:28,"You must be new to football lol, every personal foul is 15"
hrym4fb,2022-01-09 17:29:28,We would’ve scored if not for that facemask
hrym4dn,2022-01-09 17:29:27,That facemask killed us.
hrym4b6,2022-01-09 17:29:27,TJ watt strip sack touchdown
hrym42c,2022-01-09 17:29:24,"We won't pin them, they'll return for 25."
hrym41i,2022-01-09 17:29:24,Team has no drive at the energy is terrible. Doesn’t feel the same as watching a team like the cardinals or the titans…there’s no passion
hrym3q7,2022-01-09 17:29:21,Joe Haeg continues to show why he fuckin blows
hrym3ov,2022-01-09 17:29:20,Canada is so chickenshit
hrym3n9,2022-01-09 17:29:20,No but the Ravens are knocking us out
hrym3fe,2022-01-09 17:29:18,[deleted]
hrym3de,2022-01-09 17:29:17,Please Steelers. A win here would be the best birthday present ever! Please!
hrym3d2,2022-01-09 17:29:17,"D needs to be huge again. come on tj, I believe in you"
hrym3ch,2022-01-09 17:29:17,So now what? We just hope for good defense again? So frustrating
hrym3c0,2022-01-09 17:29:17,Go away then and let us enjoy the last few minutes
hrym3ag,2022-01-09 17:29:17,Defense we need something again for the 1000th time.
hrym397,2022-01-09 17:29:16,FUCK HAEG
hrym379,2022-01-09 17:29:16,On 3rd and 25?
hrym369,2022-01-09 17:29:16,Lmao
hrym348,2022-01-09 17:29:15,Offensive line is full of fucking nobody’s
hrym333,2022-01-09 17:29:15,Jfc..why not take a deep shot at the end zone?
hrym2yf,2022-01-09 17:29:14,Why wouldn’t you take a deep shot at that point? 🤔 🤦🏼‍♂️
hrym2rb,2022-01-09 17:29:12,Need a pick 6 since our offense can't get it done.
hrym2pa,2022-01-09 17:29:11,I’ll take a minkah pick 6
hrym2p6,2022-01-09 17:29:11,"Clowney did the same thing to ben with the helmet last week and the flag got picked up. There was no flag until after the run, fucking joke of a ref job"
hrylzua,2022-01-09 17:28:43,Fucking 3and 25 let’s throw for 6

hrylzmi,2022-01-09 17:28:41,What a shit punt
hrylzm1,2022-01-09 17:28:41,"Stop watching and posting then, pls."
hrylzlw,2022-01-09 17:28:41,This was a TD drive if not for that dumb fucking penalty
hrylzk8,2022-01-09 17:28:41,Wish we played with the energy of Jacksonville.  They're literally playing for nothing.
hrylzdd,2022-01-09 17:28:39,For a few years now
hrylz8c,2022-01-09 17:28:38,This offense is like a limp dick.
hrylz85,2022-01-09 17:28:38,Lol
hrylyvh,2022-01-09 17:28:35,It is tho?
hrylysu,2022-01-09 17:28:34,wtf was that… way to go haeg
hrylyrr,2022-01-09 17:28:34,Fuck Haag
hrylyqs,2022-01-09 17:28:33,Ok but that's not a facemask right? Didn't they not call that same thing last week and explain that you have to grab the grill for it to be a facemask?
hrylyqr,2022-01-09 17:28:33,Right? Like who are we beating? Lololol
hrylylc,2022-01-09 17:28:32,oh wow!!! who knew that wouldn’t work!!!
hryly64,2022-01-09 17:28:28,"if i've been watching the same game as you, yes"
hryly5b,2022-01-09 17:28:28,"Refs eyes property of the Ravens, fuckers"
hryly4t,2022-01-09 17:28:27,It’s the 4th quarter…
hryly3g,2022-01-09 17:28:27,Nice. Get to the 50 so Harvin can pin them on the 30
hryly0r,2022-01-09 17:28:26,I hate this team so much
hryly01,2022-01-09 17:28:26,That fucking personal foul may have killed us.
hrylxxs,2022-01-09 17:28:26,Booooo
hrylxx1,2022-01-09 17:28:25,Three drive I specifically remember the olive killing. End of chargers. Opening of second half against the browns first time. Now this.
hrylxsl,2022-01-09 17:28:24,Neither did I.
hrylxlw,2022-01-09 17:28:23,Rudolph would of led them to a TD on that drive.
hrylxlv,2022-01-09 17:28:23,So what makes you think that face mask didn’t cost us the game?
hrylxkt,2022-01-09 17:28:22,Um
hrylxhp,2022-01-09 17:28:22,"We can still do this!!!!! 

FIRE UPPP"
hrylxfs,2022-01-09 17:28:21,joe haeg may have literally just cost us the game lol
hrylxez,2022-01-09 17:28:21,Lmaooo great play call guys
hrylxd2,2022-01-09 17:28:20,"We’ve had several back breaker BS penalties, not a single one for the ravens."
hrylx9n,2022-01-09 17:28:19,how can you make that throw Ben
hrylx7f,2022-01-09 17:28:19,penalty wasnt on him
hrylwzp,2022-01-09 17:28:17,fuckin Joe Haeg
hrylwok,2022-01-09 17:28:14,Guess I’ll start praying for the defensive td now
hrylwn7,2022-01-09 17:28:14,That facemask penalty was absolutely crippling.
hrylwmf,2022-01-09 17:28:14,The classic 2 yard dump off 🥴
hrylwla,2022-01-09 17:28:13,He's never been smart. He was good because he was good at improvising and hard to sack.
hrylwiq,2022-01-09 17:28:13,5 yard play on 3 and 25?????
hrylwfv,2022-01-09 17:28:12,Fuck all of this
hrylwba,2022-01-09 17:28:11,A 3 yard pass… fuck this weak ass team
hrylw79,2022-01-09 17:28:10,"On the bright side, our shitty punter might actually flip the field!"
hrylw6j,2022-01-09 17:28:10,well that was worthless
hrylw62,2022-01-09 17:28:09,Jags are helping us like a motherfucker and the offense cannot for the life of them make a play.
hrylw2m,2022-01-09 17:28:08,That was the biggest bullshit face mask call
hrylsh6,2022-01-09 17:27:34,Just making me sad at this point
hrylsew,2022-01-09 17:27:33,They had a false start a few hours ago
hrylsaa,2022-01-09 17:27:32,I can't do this shit anymore
hryls91,2022-01-09 17:27:32,"Ok so that was like the first shine from Snell, after we all been ripping on him. And then the penalty takes it away! Hahahah omg"
hryls7o,2022-01-09 17:27:31,What a game changing penalty.
hryls6u,2022-01-09 17:27:31,Ref ball at its finest
hryls5w,2022-01-09 17:27:31,I didn't see him grab a facemask?
hryls5h,2022-01-09 17:27:31,Refs see the Jax score and need to make calls to help Baltimore now
hryls4b,2022-01-09 17:27:30,Nice call refs.
hryls3o,2022-01-09 17:27:30,Fuck Haeg. Dumpy piece of shit.  That turned the drive around.
hryls1d,2022-01-09 17:27:30,Fuck haeg
hrylrz9,2022-01-09 17:27:29,the oline finds a way to kill the game at any given chance
hrylrol,2022-01-09 17:27:26,Pull a stupid ravens underthrow for PI
hrylrmh,2022-01-09 17:27:25,Literally for the past two seasons every single good play we’ve had on offense outside out 3-4 has been called back
hrylrl9,2022-01-09 17:27:25,Wow. The most yards snell has ever gotten......fuck u haeg
hrylrdx,2022-01-09 17:27:23,Waive whoever #71 is
hrylrao,2022-01-09 17:27:22,Ben is making terrible decisions. Like what is he seeing?
hrylr5x,2022-01-09 17:27:21,"Come on! Our momentum was picking up! 11 minutes! Let’s get this done!

Jags 23 - Colts 3 currently with 12:53 left to play 😂"
hrylr5r,2022-01-09 17:27:21,Up and Down here
hrylr0n,2022-01-09 17:27:20,3 and 25 here comes a pitch 3 yards behind line
hrylqvs,2022-01-09 17:27:18,Refs having their say in the outcome today

hrylqfv,2022-01-09 17:27:14,Can I interest you in a draw on 3rd and 25?
hrylqe1,2022-01-09 17:27:13,We do bad team things
hrylqdj,2022-01-09 17:27:13,You can't block someone by grabbing their helmet.
hrylqay,2022-01-09 17:27:12,Jags clutched. Can we just score
hrylpww,2022-01-09 17:27:08,UGHHHHH

hrylfgz,2022-01-09 17:25:23,Well I hate the Ravens but I feel like they are trying not to aggravate Najees arm injury so respect for that
hrylfga,2022-01-09 17:25:23,it is during football season
hrylfcw,2022-01-09 17:25:22,How the fuck is najee alive
hrylf53,2022-01-09 17:25:20,One last Ben scramble :(
hrylewi,2022-01-09 17:25:17,Remember when other teams would get rough with our RB/QB our oline would go after them after? Miss them.
hrylert,2022-01-09 17:25:16,"Jacksonville is playing like their playoff hopes are on the line.

Love to see it."
hrylerd,2022-01-09 17:25:16,Every first down is a run
hryleov,2022-01-09 17:25:15,It's INSANE how much better even an injured Harris is than Snell

hryldyt,2022-01-09 17:25:08,HUGE hole on his left side there for Harris
hryldyc,2022-01-09 17:25:08,LETS FUCKING GO

hryldbm,2022-01-09 17:25:02,This is amazing from Najeeh
hrylcy9,2022-01-09 17:24:58,"God, the playbook for 3rd and 1 for us.  I miss the old days with a stout O-line and the Bus."
hrylcu4,2022-01-09 17:24:57,Nice to see the good claypool showed up today
hryl9jp,2022-01-09 17:24:24,It is when the team is this bad with the worst pass defense in the league and a backup QB you clown.
hryl9dw,2022-01-09 17:24:22,Nice little dunk to Harris - reminded me of Bell.
hryl9cb,2022-01-09 17:24:22,People are all over the place in this thread. Spanning like 3 plays.
hryl98i,2022-01-09 17:24:21,Why are we running it against the best run defense with one of the worst offensive lines lmao
hryl95m,2022-01-09 17:24:20,Did Claypool just catch the ball AND not fall down?
hryl930,2022-01-09 17:24:19,First down
hryl8xz,2022-01-09 17:24:18,rock to tha Naj
hryl8xx,2022-01-09 17:24:18,"So Jacksonville is going to win, but we still give Tomlin yet another pass for not having this squad fired up and prepared to get the job done .  When will we have the discussion about his short comings in these type of big game situations?"
hryl8ku,2022-01-09 17:24:14,Ben was just told the jags score and is in go mode.
hryl8d7,2022-01-09 17:24:12,Really miss Juju rn
hryl7zs,2022-01-09 17:24:08,Chase did t even try to block
hryl7uq,2022-01-09 17:24:07,"Run game just might not be working, nobody tell Matt!"
hryl7nt,2022-01-09 17:24:05,Ravens knew right where that was going and wasn't fooled one bit.
hryl780,2022-01-09 17:24:01,Where are you running Najee. hole was huge
hryl735,2022-01-09 17:23:59,Canada figured out a good run play? No way…
hryl6hg,2022-01-09 17:23:54,How did we go through with that? They stacked the line
hryl6f4,2022-01-09 17:23:53,You could see Najee almost stiff arm and then stop on that run
hryl33u,2022-01-09 17:23:20,Shit I thought claypool was gonna throw it for a second.
hryl2uo,2022-01-09 17:23:18,"Chase almost celebrated but didn’t. He’s growing, just be patient."
hryl2rr,2022-01-09 17:23:17,Agreed. I never see him frustrated either when he gets beat which would be a normal response from someone who cares
hryl2n3,2022-01-09 17:23:15,Yes keep running for a loss Matt Canada you fucking idiot
hryl29i,2022-01-09 17:23:12,Ooooohhhhhhhhmmmmmmmmmm

hryl1y4,2022-01-09 17:23:09,Why do we never run outside with najee 🤔
hryl1xh,2022-01-09 17:23:09,I didn't think anything would actually take that literally.
hryl1w1,2022-01-09 17:23:08,RBs getting swarmed right away.. nothing new but damn
hryl1gs,2022-01-09 17:23:04,Nice to see them trying to establish the run game
hryl1cp,2022-01-09 17:23:03,Canada needs to be in Canada
hryl0qk,2022-01-09 17:22:57,Why does Najee never lower his shoulder he thinks he’s bell he’s not
hryl0ns,2022-01-09 17:22:56,running the ball…
hryl07q,2022-01-09 17:22:52,that’s a good man

hrykw5s,2022-01-09 17:22:11,good block by najee
hrykvtf,2022-01-09 17:22:08,Ben doesn’t even let the play happen before he throws for 2yds
hrykvs5,2022-01-09 17:22:08,Claypool a better rb then he is a receiver lol
hrykvns,2022-01-09 17:22:06,I FUCKING BELIEVEEEEEE
hrykvn5,2022-01-09 17:22:06,Well you called the first play lol
hrykvl8,2022-01-09 17:22:06,NOW DIG IN AND BRING THE PAIN BABY!! LETS GOOOOOOOOOO!!
hrykv4g,2022-01-09 17:22:01,Great block by Najee.
hrykuyx,2022-01-09 17:22:00,"Tired of people bashing this defense! They are good, just can’t be expected to be great when they are on the field most of the game"
hrykuqg,2022-01-09 17:21:58,"Every week I ask myself, why are they passing against our D"
hrykuex,2022-01-09 17:21:55,Can’t wait to watch this 3 and out :)
hrykub2,2022-01-09 17:21:54,"defense trying it's darndest, offense gotta step up."
hryku5y,2022-01-09 17:21:52,LET’S FUCKING GOOOOO
hryktud,2022-01-09 17:21:49,They dumb as hell for not just running
hryktn5,2022-01-09 17:21:47,"Why would they even pass? They are grinding us to dust. That is a jackass ""I need to prove I am smart"" offensive coordinator call. Thank god the Rat birds showed bird brains."
hryktec,2022-01-09 17:21:45,There it is. Dial up that dive for Snell.
hrykt87,2022-01-09 17:21:43,BEN THIS IS IT RIGHT HERE! LETS GO
hrykt6n,2022-01-09 17:21:42,Let's fucking go boys!
hrykt2s,2022-01-09 17:21:41,"Hell of a lot better than Benny Snell, and offers something in the passing game at least."
hrykt07,2022-01-09 17:21:41,"Eh Ben is working with a terrible supporting cast. Rudolph is no better, if not worse"
hryksvp,2022-01-09 17:21:40,1 yard passes aint gonna do it
hryksln,2022-01-09 17:21:37,A fucking checkdown
hrykskj,2022-01-09 17:21:37,There you go Cam!!!
hryksiu,2022-01-09 17:21:36,"4th quarter boys!!!!! 
Let’s gooo O!!!"
hryksgs,2022-01-09 17:21:35,Cam Sutton LETS FUCKING GOOOOO big int in the end zone!
hryksfy,2022-01-09 17:21:35,"Oh yeah, it's 4th quarter Steelers time"
hryksfr,2022-01-09 17:21:35,"This defense just always seems to come up with a play when we need it. Now let’s go, O. They can’t do it alone."
hrykp9q,2022-01-09 17:21:05,Cam Sutton you beautiful bastard!
hrykp5u,2022-01-09 17:21:03,Cam Sutton keeping us alive!!
hrykp1y,2022-01-09 17:21:02,"Fucking give it a rest!   This is ravens steelers, gonna be ugly.  Let's GOOOOO"
hrykow4,2022-01-09 17:21:01,Still going to be down after another field goal /:
hrykot9,2022-01-09 17:21:00,Time to go take the lead boys
hrykool,2022-01-09 17:20:59,Best 4th quarter team ever lmao
hrykon0,2022-01-09 17:20:58,This is some of the worst football I’ve seen in a long time lol
hrykomh,2022-01-09 17:20:58,SECOND. HALF. TEAM.
hrykol6,2022-01-09 17:20:58,I’m all in for TJ to get a sack fumble to break the record and then we pick the fumble up and score
hrykoiy,2022-01-09 17:20:57,Game Saver
hrykoig,2022-01-09 17:20:57,Huge sutton
hrykohm,2022-01-09 17:20:57,3 downs in 30 seconds then a punt i'm calling it
hrykofk,2022-01-09 17:20:56,Need 7 now

hrykocc,2022-01-09 17:20:55,oh so NOW y’all wanna cheer
hrykoc8,2022-01-09 17:20:55,Like I said we only play 4th qtrs
hrykobf,2022-01-09 17:20:55,Holy shit my tv was still on commercial and missed that play let’s goooo
hryko8t,2022-01-09 17:20:54,My voice went up an octave yelling when Sutton caught that.
hryko65,2022-01-09 17:20:54,Im going to have a heart attack
hryko59,2022-01-09 17:20:53,"Yea Ik, LFG"
hryko4c,2022-01-09 17:20:53,Holy SHIT DONT FUCKTHIS UP
hryko1p,2022-01-09 17:20:53,Lolol. FOURTH QUARTER BABEEE
hryko1m,2022-01-09 17:20:53,HUGE PLAY
hryko1a,2022-01-09 17:20:52,Can't believe they passed the ball!
hryko0l,2022-01-09 17:20:52,Wow. What are the Ravens thinking throwing it?  They are averaging like 20 yards per carry. WTF.
hryknzp,2022-01-09 17:20:52,HUGE!
hryknwm,2022-01-09 17:20:51,LETS GO
hryknti,2022-01-09 17:20:50,"As I said, STOP HATING ON OUR DEFESNE!"
hryknm2,2022-01-09 17:20:48,DEEEEEFENSE!!!!
hryknm1,2022-01-09 17:20:48,Because both offenses are pretty bad
hryknix,2022-01-09 17:20:47,THANK YOU SUTTON
hryknir,2022-01-09 17:20:47,Please get some points off this Jesus Christ. Can’t get 3 turnovers and have 6 points to show for it.
hryknfm,2022-01-09 17:20:46,Damn that’s big
hryknae,2022-01-09 17:20:45,No reason to pass Ratbirds.
hrykn8o,2022-01-09 17:20:44,Sutton!!!!
hrykn8f,2022-01-09 17:20:44,Yoink!
hrykn5d,2022-01-09 17:20:43,That was a terrible read by Huntley. He had 12 wide open.
hrykn56,2022-01-09 17:20:43,Let's see how the offense completely disappoints the defense this time
hrykn1b,2022-01-09 17:20:42,WHY WOULD THEY TROW IT??? LMAO
hrykmzt,2022-01-09 17:20:42,"IS THAT BETTER, MOTHERFUCKERS?"
hrykmwv,2022-01-09 17:20:41,Bout time!!
hrykmwq,2022-01-09 17:20:41,There is hope!
hrykmui,2022-01-09 17:20:40,Why would you throw it idiots!!
hrykmto,2022-01-09 17:20:40,Now would be a good time for one of those 27 point 4th quarters that the Steelers seem to love doing!
hrykmtj,2022-01-09 17:20:40,Just like that I'm back in
hrykmsv,2022-01-09 17:20:40,TD THIS DRIVE. RIGHT NOW. RIGHT F’ING NOW
hrykmn1,2022-01-09 17:20:39,That was so freaking huge
hrykmj2,2022-01-09 17:20:37,GOD DAMN CAM SUTTON! THANK YOU
hrykmeo,2022-01-09 17:20:36,Ho Lee Fuk!
hrykmah,2022-01-09 17:20:35,Sutton can have my kids for that pick
hrykm86,2022-01-09 17:20:35,Let's goooo!!!!
hrykm64,2022-01-09 17:20:34,YESSSS
hrykm1f,2022-01-09 17:20:33,What a fucking clutch play holy shit
hryklzs,2022-01-09 17:20:33,Cameron Sutton! Now can the offense finally wake the fuck up?!
hryklym,2022-01-09 17:20:32,Maybe. I'm holding onto that last bit of optimism.
hrykly6,2022-01-09 17:20:32,Let’s hope we benefit from this.
hryklw0,2022-01-09 17:20:32,Thank god for the D
hryklus,2022-01-09 17:20:31,Clutch!!!!
hryklqu,2022-01-09 17:20:30,Wow
hryklq7,2022-01-09 17:20:30,😎
hryklmr,2022-01-09 17:20:29,No because we’re still playing and literally have an improbable window at the playoffs and this is the crap offense that’s being played right now.
hryklmo,2022-01-09 17:20:29,WAS THERE EVER A DOUBT?
hryklm4,2022-01-09 17:20:29,HOLY FUCKING TITS
hryklhx,2022-01-09 17:20:28,I want to know how it feels to lose first round again
hryklhw,2022-01-09 17:20:28,"Bro Ben can't throw the fucking ball and our offensive line is dog shit. Granted, he's not good, but the real blame lies elsewhere"
hryki4p,2022-01-09 17:19:55,Mentally prepare now that's what's going to happen.
hryki3v,2022-01-09 17:19:55,He’s a below average safety but this sub loves him for some reason
hrykhxl,2022-01-09 17:19:53,Or nashville
hrykhx0,2022-01-09 17:19:53,QUIT BITCHING BOYS WE HAVE ANOTHER QUARTER
hrykhrj,2022-01-09 17:19:51,And Murray looks like Bo Jackson!
hrykhly,2022-01-09 17:19:50,"Starts a ""We want Deshaun"" chant."
hrykhe4,2022-01-09 17:19:48,I was expecting a tie tonight would do us in
hrykhd1,2022-01-09 17:19:47,"Awful all around, but some of this blame definitely falls on Tomlin. Zero preparation for an undermanned ravens team. No urgency in a game that’s very winnable. One of the more pathetic Steelers games this year so far"
hrykh6h,2022-01-09 17:19:46,"Pic 6
Lmfao ok int"
hrykh5o,2022-01-09 17:19:46,Its close enough to pull this out!
hrykh15,2022-01-09 17:19:44,Maybe. Ben has looked awful.
hrykh06,2022-01-09 17:19:44,"If we’re being honest it’s tough to say, we’ve seen mason perform good and bad but usually he performs better when he gets the majority of reps at practice so."
hrykgwi,2022-01-09 17:19:43,This is the take. We should have gotten more than 3 points off of the two forced turnovers and the one turnover on downs.
hrykguk,2022-01-09 17:19:43,"Yup, definition of wasted potential. Has all the tools but clearly can’t read a playbook or watch film"
hrykgtr,2022-01-09 17:19:42,Because we can’t stop the run.
hrykgrj,2022-01-09 17:19:42,I can't give a defense that gives up 200 rushing a pass.
hrykgqk,2022-01-09 17:19:42,Tbh. This is par.  8 -8. 9-7. Average seasons no losing seasons. However winning super bowls is long gone.
hrykgjs,2022-01-09 17:19:40,4th quarter heart attack LETTSS GOOOOOOOOO
hrykg9l,2022-01-09 17:19:37,What a trash way for Ben to end his career.
hrykg9k,2022-01-09 17:19:37,Yes
hrykg9g,2022-01-09 17:19:37,"Minus the ability to stop the run. Once the ravens figured that out, they stopped passing. Except andrews in the endzone."
hrykfpi,2022-01-09 17:19:32,About the same.
hrykfm5,2022-01-09 17:19:31,SHUT THE FUCK UP AND ROOT FOR THIS GOD DAMN TEAM
hrykfll,2022-01-09 17:19:30,"Lamar plays to our strength. He holds ball longer looking for big shots. Let's us intercept.

Huntley is doing quick throws"
hrykfj4,2022-01-09 17:19:30,Shazier was the last good one.
hrykfit,2022-01-09 17:19:30,Better option than Ray Ray.
hrykfgz,2022-01-09 17:19:29,Just run it toward that Devin Bush sized hole
hrykfe1,2022-01-09 17:19:29,"We have scored only 2 points more than that 4 the whole game. 

So...yeah.

I hope I'm wrong though.

* I'm wrong!!!!"
hrykezy,2022-01-09 17:19:25,This team is lethargic.
hrykewm,2022-01-09 17:19:24,Team Captains step up and GET LOUD!! GET MOTIVATED!!
hrykevw,2022-01-09 17:19:24,Alright ready for 4th quarter Ben
hrykeue,2022-01-09 17:19:24,"Even without today’s disgraceful showing, this team has absolutely no business in the playoffs. On the plus side, the JAX win is gonna put $200 in my pocket, so there’s that."
hryketx,2022-01-09 17:19:23,This team is thoroughly mediocre. Both sides of the ball.
hrykbs3,2022-01-09 17:18:53,They might be in the playoffs already if Harbaugh kicked a couple extra points during the season.
hrykbo6,2022-01-09 17:18:52,"I don't know what team you've been watching this season, but we could possibly crawl through? or get dragged through.

I don't know about walk."
hrykbnb,2022-01-09 17:18:52,Hopefully we can get TJ schemed up against Big AL should be good for 5 sacks if it’s 1on1
hrykbih,2022-01-09 17:18:51,"just switched to Paramount Plus to watch it, let's see if it's any better"
hrykbib,2022-01-09 17:18:51,"Honestly, a win gets us a blowout in KC.. It just extends the bad season a week. I rather have a few spots better pick."
hrykbdz,2022-01-09 17:18:50,"Right, this Steelers team winning in Baltimore was always the hardest part of the equation…"
hrykb9u,2022-01-09 17:18:48,Given both tbh. The run defense has shown all season they can’t tackle or slow down any runner. They’re abysmal. Ravens can effortlessly get 5-7 yards per run.
hrykb9g,2022-01-09 17:18:48,"If These are the shows that CBS shows, I want to see the shows they DIDNT give the green light to."
hrykb4s,2022-01-09 17:18:47,No
hrykb3u,2022-01-09 17:18:47,"As much as I don’t care to see us go to the playoffs as we will almost certainly do another one and done, I really just want to see us win and play strong"
hrykax9,2022-01-09 17:18:45,[deleted]
hrykaux,2022-01-09 17:18:44,No.
hrykasb,2022-01-09 17:18:44,He’s been calling the defense for years.
hrykaqp,2022-01-09 17:18:43,"This is pathetic, and as always certain individuals will be shielded from any criticism. All while the Jags are taking care of business."
hrykaoz,2022-01-09 17:18:43,You're why this sub fucking blows during game threads.
hrykakn,2022-01-09 17:18:41,"We have tons of time

Unfortunately there has been nothing promising about this offense the whole game 

I kept giving Canada chances but this is bullshit on how bad the playcalling has been"
hrykaif,2022-01-09 17:18:41,"Yes. 

And if you don't care about beating the Ravens, you should buy some Browns gear"
hrykagv,2022-01-09 17:18:40,It's like the Steelers have been specifically engineering this game to give Ben one last GWD.
hrykae9,2022-01-09 17:18:40,*trips over shoe strings*
hrykacn,2022-01-09 17:18:39,The defense came out and had 2 turnovers and held them to 3 points at half. I don’t know how that’s not amped.
hryka7s,2022-01-09 17:18:38,Man this sucks so fucking hard
hryka4p,2022-01-09 17:18:37,If they get 7 here it's over
hryka09,2022-01-09 17:18:36,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bagCFX\_Guw
hryk9r8,2022-01-09 17:18:33,Uninformed take.
hryk9ie,2022-01-09 17:18:31,Hold them to 3 get the ball back and let Ben do his 4th quarter magic
hryk9g2,2022-01-09 17:18:30,You misspelled bush and leave him in Baltimore to get his own ride home
hryk9es,2022-01-09 17:18:30,"As Ian Eagle finished his statement about going to the fourth quarter, I felt my blood pressure spike."
hryk9e5,2022-01-09 17:18:30,He would if he had a good oline and we're playing the worst rush defense in the league.
hryk9cf,2022-01-09 17:18:29,"Defense playing bad right now, but offense has been putrid. Defense is the only reason we haven’t lost yet"
hryk989,2022-01-09 17:18:28,100% they getting cooked.
hryk95o,2022-01-09 17:18:27,Reminder that this is the Ravens backup QB.
hryk8yc,2022-01-09 17:18:25,[deleted]
hryk8ky,2022-01-09 17:18:22,Because the front SUCKS. He gets tons f opportunities. And he still blows tackles every week.
hryk8h3,2022-01-09 17:18:21,I am not high in Mason at all but do you guys think he would have given them the best chance to win this game?
hryk8fz,2022-01-09 17:18:20,We are just waiting for the fourth quarter so that Ben can have another “fourth quarter comeback” on the books.
hryk858,2022-01-09 17:18:18,My thoughts exactly. The past few years where we needed help and got none and now that the stars finally align we shit the bed
hryk5jv,2022-01-09 17:17:52,He literally did earlier today until we got called for a false start
hryk5io,2022-01-09 17:17:51,Just a few more seconds before our offense is legally allowed to make plays in the 4th quarter.
hryk5h1,2022-01-09 17:17:51,this team is terrible
hryk5gm,2022-01-09 17:17:51,If you didn’t expect Harbaugh to completely out coach Tomlin at the half I envy your blissful ignorance
hryk5fx,2022-01-09 17:17:51,This was predictable but still blows
hryk58u,2022-01-09 17:17:49,Tomlin doing a great job coaching up this D against the run. Great game plan.  /s
hryk559,2022-01-09 17:17:48,I mean losing away at the Ravens isn't exactly an unthinkable scenario. They're not great but we've been a little worse all year.
hryk53m,2022-01-09 17:17:47,Can we get some of that 4 quarter offense?
hryk52j,2022-01-09 17:17:47,"Even if he did, we can't  run for inches"
hryk4zc,2022-01-09 17:17:46,Calling it now we’re going to drop 17 in the fourth and Ben with the walkoff W!
hryk4xn,2022-01-09 17:17:46,"Standard is the standard. 

Don’t worry I’m sure he’ll remember to tip his cap to the ravens and their backup qb"
hryk4tw,2022-01-09 17:17:45,Please hold them to a FG
hryk4s1,2022-01-09 17:17:44,4th QTR Boys!  Our time to shine!
hryk4r7,2022-01-09 17:17:44,I can't figure out why any team throws against us. You don't need to apparently and just gives us a chance for sacks and turnovers
hryk4o3,2022-01-09 17:17:43,Baltimore should go for it every 4th down whats the worse that will happen Pittsburg gets a field goal as a result ?
hryk4da,2022-01-09 17:17:40,Need to hold them to 3…
hryk4bp,2022-01-09 17:17:39,By necessity. He still blows tackles week in and week out and it’s on film for everyone to see.
hryk480,2022-01-09 17:17:39,"It's happening! We are losing to the rat birds and Jax are winning... The opposite to what I wanted, since playoffs won't do us any good."
hryk473,2022-01-09 17:17:38,A two score lead is probably insurmountable.
hryk3zl,2022-01-09 17:17:36,4th Quarter boys - send some energy to this shit run D and let’s get this
hryk3qj,2022-01-09 17:17:34,Lol. Wish we would’ve just gone 0-17 so we could at least have a good pick
hryk38d,2022-01-09 17:17:29,"I mean, why bother passing when they can rush 5 yards per run"
hryk36k,2022-01-09 17:17:28,Have to hold them to a field goal here.... Not sure came come back from any larger deficit
hryk353,2022-01-09 17:17:28,I'll miss the good ole days with Ben but it's time for him to go. His inability to throw the ball farther than 5 yards is why we only have 6 points against one of the worst pass defenses in the league. You're crazy to blame this on Canada.
hryk32f,2022-01-09 17:17:27,This is fucking miserable
hryk318,2022-01-09 17:17:27,"One more quarter of Ben’s career, possibly. I wanna win. But let’s just try to savor it."
hryk30n,2022-01-09 17:17:27,Only the Steelers can find a way to go .500 in a season with 17 games.
hryk2zo,2022-01-09 17:17:26,Sucking isn't choking.  It's sucking.
hryk2ya,2022-01-09 17:17:26,Prepare thy anus
hryk2xe,2022-01-09 17:17:26,Imagine not wanting to make the playoffs lol
hryk2mh,2022-01-09 17:17:23,I refuse to overreact right now. 15 minutes of professional football left. This team blooms late. Fuckin-a let's go Stillers
hryk2i5,2022-01-09 17:17:22,Haven't had any for years....sigh
hryk2fm,2022-01-09 17:17:21,Not looking good guys
hryk2d4,2022-01-09 17:17:20,You never know
hryk2ck,2022-01-09 17:17:20,"Just remember, Tomlin’s calling the defense this week. So much for being well known for his defense side."
hryk2ca,2022-01-09 17:17:20,Last week was nice but if this continues this is gonna be one pitiful fucking game for Ben to go out on.
hryk2c2,2022-01-09 17:17:20,They ate that clock the hell up too. Not good.
hryk2bx,2022-01-09 17:17:20,At least keep the Ravens out of the playoffs please. I’m tired of watching their high school offense getting blown out by actual contenders in the playoffs
hryk2ak,2022-01-09 17:17:20,"Yeah, I agree. People have been defending him all season saying he’s not 100%, but he’s lazy, low football IQ and is looking more and more like a bust."
hryk26r,2022-01-09 17:17:18,For a few years now.
hryk247,2022-01-09 17:17:18,Anyone notice the lack of replays of close plays?
hryk1vp,2022-01-09 17:17:16,They are running the same play every time..
hryjze1,2022-01-09 17:16:51,Perfect example of bandwagon fandom.
hryjzbi,2022-01-09 17:16:50,Watch out the Tomlin fanboys will come after you
hryjz7k,2022-01-09 17:16:49,[deleted]
hryjz6g,2022-01-09 17:16:49,Wow tomlin wouldn’t have gone for that
hryjz5h,2022-01-09 17:16:49,Great work Edmunds worrying about the spot instead of tackling the dude
hryjyz9,2022-01-09 17:16:47,If we don’t emphasize line of scrimmage this upcoming draft I will not be watching this team next year
hryjyxw,2022-01-09 17:16:47,Damn they just showed that play by Trevor Lawrence. He was running away and he just lobbed it up to the wr. Nice.
hryjyxq,2022-01-09 17:16:47,A touchdown here probably effectively ends the game given our offense.
hryjytu,2022-01-09 17:16:45,"We knew this would happen. Sad it has to end this way with Ben. Gonna be an awkward press conference for Tomlin. But you know, standard is the standard… missing playoffs when it’s gift wrapped for us"
hryjyig,2022-01-09 17:16:42,Adams is getting blown off the ball every single snap... Ugh!
hryjydz,2022-01-09 17:16:41,Dick LeBeau isn’t dead?
hryjyd6,2022-01-09 17:16:41,Thank God but man we need to stop the run now
hryjy5h,2022-01-09 17:16:39,"Who cares, does anyone actually believe if we won today, we would somehow magically look different in the playoffs and upset anyone?"
hryjxpm,2022-01-09 17:16:35,"Please, come on, let’s do thissssss."
hryjxpb,2022-01-09 17:16:35,the Jags are actually going to win and we’re actually going to lose aren’t we lol
hryjxhy,2022-01-09 17:16:33,Nope I think Ben was done a month ago
hryjwsw,2022-01-09 17:16:26,"FG or turnover, or it’s over imo"
hryjwpx,2022-01-09 17:16:25,How were we unprepared on 4th down
hryjwlj,2022-01-09 17:16:24,Tomlin is calling the defense today.
hryjwic,2022-01-09 17:16:23,If the Ravens throw the ball even five more times in this game Harbaugh and his entire staff should be shitcanned.
hryjw7h,2022-01-09 17:16:20,I wish Ben would zip a fastball at Hochuli's schnoz
hryjw6n,2022-01-09 17:16:20,They’d never take Ben out of potentially his last game
hryjvv5,2022-01-09 17:16:17,If I was opposing oc I would run it between the tackles against us every single play. It amazes me how much teams pass.
hryjvud,2022-01-09 17:16:17,Jags are doing their part but Ben sucks
hryjsc0,2022-01-09 17:15:43,We could’ve gotten Brian Burns over this fucking bum Bush
hryjs3p,2022-01-09 17:15:41,Yea that game is pretty irrelevant at this point
hryjs1h,2022-01-09 17:15:40,Bush is not big enough for the nfl
hryjs0s,2022-01-09 17:15:40,"If we blow this and the Jags win, I’m gonna be fkn pissed"
hryjrxi,2022-01-09 17:15:39,"Know the commercial where they pretend the football is a baby and he runs for a touchdown, well the opponents don't even need that trick to fool this defense"
hryjrut,2022-01-09 17:15:38,Linebackers are the worst in the league
hryjrrl,2022-01-09 17:15:38,"I hate that you are so right.

It’s not over. We have seen crazy comebacks. But still. Just sucks."
hryjrkd,2022-01-09 17:15:36,Just a reminder that we’re playing against a 3rd string RB with a backup QB with half their defense missing on IR.
hryjrc5,2022-01-09 17:15:33,Got people back off injury and the run defense got worse
hryjrc0,2022-01-09 17:15:33,Already are bro
hryjr3m,2022-01-09 17:15:31,You'd rather the Ravens make the playoffs instead?
hryjr2r,2022-01-09 17:15:31,"We shouldn't be hoping for playoffs. I love this team, but the Steelers do not deserve it. At this point, I just want it to be sure that TJ Watt breaks the sack record."
hryjqxb,2022-01-09 17:15:30,WHAT THE FUCK ARE THEY DOING
hryjqww,2022-01-09 17:15:30,Will this be Butler's final game?
hryjqw2,2022-01-09 17:15:30,I hate this team so much lol
hryjqvf,2022-01-09 17:15:29,He's our leading tackler
hryjqrw,2022-01-09 17:15:28,I'm definitely rooting for the Chargers tonight.
hryjqrv,2022-01-09 17:15:28,Why do we pay Devin Bush
hryjqm8,2022-01-09 17:15:27,I can’t believe how much we miss Vince. He did one thing really well. Run fills.
hryjqgq,2022-01-09 17:15:25,"Carson Wentz should just retire, he's embarrassing lol"
hryjqfy,2022-01-09 17:15:25,Yea it’s pathetic. Is he just weak? Undersized? I just don’t get it
hryjqex,2022-01-09 17:15:25,"184 rushing yards vs our 40 yards.

Please for the love of god fix the offensive line this offseason."
hryjq37,2022-01-09 17:15:22,Imagine not having an answer for Latavius Murray...
hryjpxu,2022-01-09 17:15:20,STOP SHOWING ME JAGS UPDATES AND MAKING ME MORE DEPRESSED
hryjpuq,2022-01-09 17:15:19,"I love Tomlin, but if he doesn't have the authority to take those linebackers out of the game, is he really the coach?"
hryjpsu,2022-01-09 17:15:19,"Watt isn't getting another sack, Bal will just run rest of the game"
hryjpme,2022-01-09 17:15:17,At what point do we dump this fucking idiot Canada
hryjpk4,2022-01-09 17:15:16,"Fucked up his elbow in the first series, just came back in last series"
hryjp9v,2022-01-09 17:15:13,90% of steelers fans
hryjp8q,2022-01-09 17:15:13,So sick of hearing that
hryjp5x,2022-01-09 17:15:12,But no losing seasons means he's is irreplaceable!!!!
hryjovu,2022-01-09 17:15:10,Have to hold the Rats to a FG.
hryjlzz,2022-01-09 17:14:43,"Nah those weren't jokes, that's just stiller football"
hryjlzk,2022-01-09 17:14:43,Highsmith getting bitched
hryjlq5,2022-01-09 17:14:40,Devin bush is so soft in the middle
hryjlpp,2022-01-09 17:14:40,Weird how last week when bush didn’t play the run defense wasn’t bad and now the Ravens are running right at him to wild success. Weird how that happens.
hryjlpo,2022-01-09 17:14:40,just keep running it.
hryjlov,2022-01-09 17:14:40,Because their linemen are destroying our front seven.
hryjlkl,2022-01-09 17:14:38,How are the playoffs on the line for this team 💀
hryjlj3,2022-01-09 17:14:38,"There's no way the Ravens would ever let him go to us since he'll be a ERFA, but man I'd love it if we could get Huntley in for a look in the off-season."
hryjlg4,2022-01-09 17:14:37,Well.
hryjldi,2022-01-09 17:14:37,Adams not even trying it seems...
hryjlab,2022-01-09 17:14:36,Why blame the defense. We need more than 6 points in the playoffs
hryjl94,2022-01-09 17:14:35,"Jags W on lock

Over to the Steelers. Do they want it? It doesn't look like it"
hryjl8z,2022-01-09 17:14:35,Murray doing a better job of tackling himself than we are
hryjl7u,2022-01-09 17:14:35,Gameplanning before games? Never heard of her
hryjl0x,2022-01-09 17:14:33,Is Najee injured?
hryjkw6,2022-01-09 17:14:32,"Cmon D!!!! 

Stay switched on there’s still every fuckin chance we can do this!!"
hryjkuz,2022-01-09 17:14:32,Dude they could've picked up a hobo in downtown Baltimore and still gashed us
hryjkqr,2022-01-09 17:14:30,Jesus Christ.
hryjknb,2022-01-09 17:14:29,Have we forgot how to defend
hryjkmd,2022-01-09 17:14:29,What in the fuck GG
hryjkm0,2022-01-09 17:14:29,It probably wouldn’t bother me as much if it weren’t the Ravens.
hryjkk2,2022-01-09 17:14:29,"run defense is a joke and offense is putrid and stunted, I love this team but watching us lose another playoff game is not on my idea of a good time 🤷🏽‍♀️"
hryjkhu,2022-01-09 17:14:28,Have you guys forgot we only try in the 4th quarter this will be an easy come back!
hryjkfl,2022-01-09 17:14:27,Sorry bud game was over well before this
hryjkdg,2022-01-09 17:14:27,Paper curtain
hryjkc5,2022-01-09 17:14:26,"This team has so many more glaring issues than who will be QB next year. This D line CANNOT stop the run, and Canada is so completely inept at calling an offense."
hryjkbo,2022-01-09 17:14:26,That's embarrassing
hryjk5w,2022-01-09 17:14:25,rushing defense is so horrendous
hryjjzs,2022-01-09 17:14:23,Dick LeBeau is spinning in his grave right now.
hryjjz7,2022-01-09 17:14:23,Now they'll pass to Andrews. Watch out for play action.
hryjjyx,2022-01-09 17:14:22,Honestly this is very much a predictable Tomlin led team loss.
hryjjuy,2022-01-09 17:14:21,Bush better not be back next season.
hryjjpc,2022-01-09 17:14:20,This guy knows what he’s talking about
hryjjm3,2022-01-09 17:14:19,Canada is terrible at his job and Tomlin refuses to make adjustments during a game or season. They set their plan and if it doesn't work well we're going to keep doing it.
hryjjj8,2022-01-09 17:14:18,Of course this is how this game would go lol omg
hryjjge,2022-01-09 17:14:18,WHY CANT WE STOP THE RUN
hryjjfq,2022-01-09 17:14:17,WHYYY do we make every washed up 45 year old RB look like Derrick Henry!? I can’t even with this team sometimes..
hryjjdt,2022-01-09 17:14:17,[deleted]
hryjjcf,2022-01-09 17:14:16,Our whole offense should be ashamed after they see how the Jaguars play their hearts out.
hryjj7z,2022-01-09 17:14:15,Defense is cooked. This game is over.
hryjj6p,2022-01-09 17:14:15,TOUCHDOWN JAGS🐆🤪🐆🤪🤪
hryjizw,2022-01-09 17:14:13,There's a playoff spot on the line! WTF IS THIS SHIT!!???
hryjiys,2022-01-09 17:14:13,Unbelievable that we can’t get this done for Ben with the jags winning
hryjimy,2022-01-09 17:14:10,We could all see it coming from a mile away
hryjik0,2022-01-09 17:14:09,"I wish I could watch these games like a normal person and just go back to my life the second they’re over. 

But if we lose this game and the jags win it might ruin my either month"
hryjifx,2022-01-09 17:14:08,[deleted]
hryjeq8,2022-01-09 17:13:33,Holy fuck. Latavious Murray of all people gashing us
hryjend,2022-01-09 17:13:32,How is a body slam after the whistle not a flag? They had no issue calling it on cam in a bang bang play
hryjem2,2022-01-09 17:13:32,Folding when it matters the most has been a Steelers trademark for the past decade. Everyone should have seen this scenario coming.
hryjelt,2022-01-09 17:13:32,2 score lead incoming.  Welp.
hryjej6,2022-01-09 17:13:31,"From the league, not just the game."
hryjehn,2022-01-09 17:13:31,Big Bum
hryjeg3,2022-01-09 17:13:30,Colts getting skull fucked 23-3 and yall gonna lose this smh come on
hryje9f,2022-01-09 17:13:28,I hate football
hryje73,2022-01-09 17:13:28,You gotta be shitting me
hryje6f,2022-01-09 17:13:28,And a WR that doesn't drop the ball
hryje5k,2022-01-09 17:13:27,"lmao up the middle, and nobody touches him."
hryje0e,2022-01-09 17:13:26,They called unnecessary roughness after Huntley already fucking tucked it to run. Ben got slammed waaaaay after the whistle. Give me a fucking break. Just one fucking break.
hryjdu2,2022-01-09 17:13:24,SAME. FUCKING. PLAY.
hryjdsf,2022-01-09 17:13:24,Not irony.
hryjdoh,2022-01-09 17:13:23,This game is over. Ravens want it more.
hryjdni,2022-01-09 17:13:23,This defense needs turnovers to stop anyone. They really do.
hryjdkr,2022-01-09 17:13:22,Means nothing if we keep getting three and outs and throwing bubble screens
hryjd9u,2022-01-09 17:13:19,We are pretty crappy. Looks like that run D is showing up today!
hryjd6q,2022-01-09 17:13:18,Trevor Lawrence is out here looking like Brady and we are fucking around with fucking Ray Ray McCloud
hryjd27,2022-01-09 17:13:17,This team doesn't deserve the playoffs. Devin bush is shaping up to be one of the worst picks in steelers history.. shits a joke.
hryjcz6,2022-01-09 17:13:16,Tomlins teams never show up for these type of games...
hryjclq,2022-01-09 17:13:12,game over this team sucks
hryjcfi,2022-01-09 17:13:11,Steelers run d is straight trash 🗑🔥 ?! It's been hard to watch this season.
hryjc27,2022-01-09 17:13:07,Colts getting full on embarrassed right now
hryjbw7,2022-01-09 17:13:05,He will be a top 3 back real soon
hryjbnw,2022-01-09 17:13:03,I can think if maybe 3 people worth re-signing this off-season
hryjbbd,2022-01-09 17:13:00,"Yeah, they played to the 5th whistle"
hryjb9r,2022-01-09 17:12:59,They're letting their one shot slip away.
hryjb5e,2022-01-09 17:12:58,A wild card game on a Monday? That’s so dumb and an even more unfair advantage for the team that plays them the following week
hryjb1z,2022-01-09 17:12:57,Lol what a fucking joke this team is. All we had to do was win. Love ya Big Ben but you needed to go a season ago
hryjb0c,2022-01-09 17:12:57,Jags are more deserving of a playoff spot than this team.
hryjazi,2022-01-09 17:12:57,Hope Witherspoon is ok 🙏
hryj8j5,2022-01-09 17:12:32,Where was the flag on that Ben hit? Dude got slammed to the ground after 15 whistles. Fucking ridiculous.
hryj8id,2022-01-09 17:12:32,That was just a missed tackle at the line. He didn't look blocked at all and let them gain yards.
hryj8ak,2022-01-09 17:12:30,Nice to know the refs don't wanna call obvious holds
hryj80u,2022-01-09 17:12:28,Jacksonville hands us a great opportunity and the Steelers just fucking implode like always
hryj7vu,2022-01-09 17:12:26,I'd kill for a run like that...
hryj7um,2022-01-09 17:12:26,Well shit
hryj7qd,2022-01-09 17:12:25,we make guys who couldn't even get signed in the off-season look like Adrian Petersen. lmao
hryj7of,2022-01-09 17:12:24,Don’t worry guys the 4th quarter hasn’t started yet
hryj7n8,2022-01-09 17:12:24,"I mean you literally have a running QB on the other side and they are calling Roughing penalties for hitting an active runner, but a guy sitting back in the pocket like that not getting those calls. So tired of it."
hryj7i3,2022-01-09 17:12:23,The jags are doing everything they can for us and we still can’t do anything. This offense is fucking atrocious
hryj7ec,2022-01-09 17:12:22,I'm torn between wanting us to win and wanting us to lose. This team does not need to go to the playoffs....
hryj79g,2022-01-09 17:12:21,Lol the jags are opening it up
hryj6y7,2022-01-09 17:12:18,"fuck the nfl, it might as well be wwe"
hryj6sm,2022-01-09 17:12:16,Jesus fucking Christ our run defense is fucking awful.
hryj6qt,2022-01-09 17:12:16,We don't play till the 4th qtr anyways
hryj6ly,2022-01-09 17:12:14,Not Spoon.
hryj6kl,2022-01-09 17:12:14,[deleted]
hryj6hs,2022-01-09 17:12:13,The Jags are gonna win and we're gonna squander the chance... but let's just get TJ another sack or 2...
hryj678,2022-01-09 17:12:10,This run defense blows
hryj64u,2022-01-09 17:12:10,"Well at least Bush tackled the center….


Dumbest player in football"
hryj62o,2022-01-09 17:12:09,Ben is too ugly
hryj5yx,2022-01-09 17:12:08,Guess it’s fitting though. Offensive and defensive line failing them in the most important game.
hryj5rl,2022-01-09 17:12:06,Should’ve been
hryj5pt,2022-01-09 17:12:06,We are useless
hryj5p2,2022-01-09 17:12:05,lol jags are winning 23-3
hryj5oo,2022-01-09 17:12:05,Cant stop the run against the shittiest run game in the league 🤡 hurts to see
hryj5hk,2022-01-09 17:12:04,I’m convinced a person with no legs could run for 200 on this defense
hryj5cu,2022-01-09 17:12:02,Literally all of them.
hryj5bt,2022-01-09 17:12:02,TJ Watt Strip Sack and Minkah scoring for a TD come on
hryj58q,2022-01-09 17:12:01,RayRay has the hands of Ike Taylor
hryj50s,2022-01-09 17:11:59,Ofc Jax is gonna win but we’re gonna lise
hryj50h,2022-01-09 17:11:58,Can we stop throwing in the direction of McCloud?
hryj4uc,2022-01-09 17:11:57,This is the way

hryj21z,2022-01-09 17:11:30,If that's Brady it's getting flagged
hryj217,2022-01-09 17:11:30,No flag for UR?????
hryj20v,2022-01-09 17:11:30,"This team fucking blows man no way around it, at least we won’t have to watch these bums next week"
hryj1tx,2022-01-09 17:11:28,he lifted his legs too. Thats a penalty even not against a QB. Fuck Hocculi. Piece of shit family
hryj1q1,2022-01-09 17:11:27,Thought the same thing.
hryj1lc,2022-01-09 17:11:25,Oh that’s not unnecessary roughness?! ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?!?!

hryj19w,2022-01-09 17:11:22,Holy fuck these receivers are infuriating. Stay on your feet and catch the fucking ball.
hryj19p,2022-01-09 17:11:22,Ok maybe defense can get another turnover and win this for us
hryj19n,2022-01-09 17:11:22,Edmunds held there
hryj14r,2022-01-09 17:11:21,I heard it on the radio broadcast before TV came back
hryj104,2022-01-09 17:11:20,"Whistle blown, Ravens still manhandling Big Ben, throw him down after, no flag.

Huntley lowers his head when Heyward tackles him and we get hit with unnecessary roughness.

Fuck the refs."
hryj0zj,2022-01-09 17:11:20,Najee comes back and the offense is instantly electric.
hryj0vy,2022-01-09 17:11:19,"A agree but they aren't going to call that unless it's egregious.


Now we let Murray run for 30"

hryizzx,2022-01-09 17:11:10,Damn no roughing the passer? They fucking slammed him after the whistle blew.
hryizzt,2022-01-09 17:11:10,how was that throw at the end not a flag?
hryizxq,2022-01-09 17:11:10,HOW IS THAT NOT FLAGGED but they flag Heyward
hryizno,2022-01-09 17:11:07,Now that was an actual roughing the passer but of course not called
hryizmu,2022-01-09 17:11:07,The defense is going to have to score…
hryizlr,2022-01-09 17:11:06,wide open in the middle lol
hryizin,2022-01-09 17:11:06,How is that not a flag???
hryizaj,2022-01-09 17:11:04,How is that not roughing the passer?
hryiz9p,2022-01-09 17:11:03,3 and outs are fun
hryiz4y,2022-01-09 17:11:02,We’re gonna just need a pick six. It’s the only way we win
hryiz2u,2022-01-09 17:11:02,Imagine watching this game and being satisfied with who’s coaching our team lmaoo. We’re playing against a backup with half their team on IR
hryiyng,2022-01-09 17:10:57,I guess slamming Ben down 12 seconds after the whistle is fine. Do that to Brady and you’d get fuckin suspended
hryiylm,2022-01-09 17:10:57,Total bullshit.
hryiykp,2022-01-09 17:10:57,No unnecessary roughness for slamming Ben down after the whistle?
hryiyix,2022-01-09 17:10:56,that was like ten times more roughing than the Heyward play
hryiyi7,2022-01-09 17:10:56,Throw a fucking flag! Bullshit. They slammed him 3 seconds after whistle
hryiyi1,2022-01-09 17:10:56,WHAT THE HECK
hryiyhy,2022-01-09 17:10:56,"Annnnd no flag, nice respect their refs"
hryiyb3,2022-01-09 17:10:54,Where the UR penalty for us? Whistles for 5 sec before they throw Ben to the turf.
hryiyaw,2022-01-09 17:10:54,Hard to be critical of Ben today with what today is but he had TE wide open. It is what it is
hryiv2x,2022-01-09 17:10:22,Whistles blowing for 10 seconds. Still tackle him straight to the ground. No flag. Ok
hryiv02,2022-01-09 17:10:21,These stupid rollout playcalls
hryiux9,2022-01-09 17:10:20,No roughing? Lol
hryiuur,2022-01-09 17:10:20,How is that not roughing
hryiuue,2022-01-09 17:10:19,NO FLAGG????
hryiuts,2022-01-09 17:10:19,How do we not get a flag on the takedown?
hryiusg,2022-01-09 17:10:19,No flag for slamming Ben to the ground way after several whistles? Great stuff
hryiuku,2022-01-09 17:10:16,Jags are fucking balling and we’re giving Ray Ray 10 targets
hryiujt,2022-01-09 17:10:16,How tf is that not roughing the passer?
hryiui7,2022-01-09 17:10:16,"Consider yourself lucky, It’s a shit show"
hryiuhl,2022-01-09 17:10:16,This offense is gross.
hryiugo,2022-01-09 17:10:15,Ughhhh
hryiuee,2022-01-09 17:10:15,Please for the love of god put Ray Ray on a plane outta here
hryiubs,2022-01-09 17:10:14,TE wide open in the middle of field WIDE ASS OPEN
hryiu8f,2022-01-09 17:10:13,Just put 5 garbage pails in front of Ben. No different at this point.
hryiu84,2022-01-09 17:10:13,Where’s the flag on that shit? Slamming him after the whistle?
hryiu7j,2022-01-09 17:10:13,FUCK MCCLOUD FUCK MCCLOUD FUCK MCCLOUD
hryiu4a,2022-01-09 17:10:12,This offense bruh...
hryiu28,2022-01-09 17:10:12,LOL NO FLAG EH
hryiu0w,2022-01-09 17:10:11,Ray Ray must be a practice god or something
hryiu09,2022-01-09 17:10:11,And for good reason.
hryitzo,2022-01-09 17:10:11,"Alright it's becoming pretty clear, Jax is gonna win. So need a major step up on both sides of the ball.."
hryitws,2022-01-09 17:10:10,Dangerous bringing Najee in hurt like this. Carrying in his non dominant hand and I’m sure his arm doesn’t feel great
hryitsj,2022-01-09 17:10:09,HOW IS IT NOT ROUGHING THE PASSER TO THROW BEN DOWN WELL AFTER THE WHISTLE? THATS FUCKING BULLSHIT
hryitep,2022-01-09 17:10:05,Offense is fucking brutal
hryitde,2022-01-09 17:10:05,No late hit!!?!?!??!?
hryitb0,2022-01-09 17:10:04,How isn't that a personal foul
hryit7s,2022-01-09 17:10:03,That should be unnecessary roughness
hryit5z,2022-01-09 17:10:03,">Jacksonville came to play!

Glad someone did."
hryisvg,2022-01-09 17:10:00,Every 2-yard out to McCloud takes a year off my life at this point.
hryisu6,2022-01-09 17:10:00,Too bad we are wasting that jags game with the shittiest offense in the league
hryistq,2022-01-09 17:10:00,Come on
hryisps,2022-01-09 17:09:59,WHERES THE FUCKING FLAG
hryisp3,2022-01-09 17:09:58,WHERES THE MOTHERFUCKING FLAG!?!?
hryism6,2022-01-09 17:09:58,You know things are going well with the run game when the plan is tape up Harris and bring him back out injured.
hryishq,2022-01-09 17:09:56,He threw him down where’s the 15 yards?? Soft league
hryisei,2022-01-09 17:09:56,Ray Ray McCloud I will see you in my nightmares
hryis1u,2022-01-09 17:09:52,This offense is putrid
hryis0y,2022-01-09 17:09:52,Ray Ray is fucking awful
hryiryl,2022-01-09 17:09:51,Someone tell ray ray and DJ to switch jerseys
hryirtp,2022-01-09 17:09:50,He's thrown down after whistle how is that not roughing the passer
hryiri2,2022-01-09 17:09:47,Maybe the last 3-4 years but certainly not hid whole career.
hryirf1,2022-01-09 17:09:46,Good Christ.
hryiraa,2022-01-09 17:09:45,"fucking hell this game is buffering for me on YouTube TV, all other channels working flawlessly and getting 400mpbs down, I guess the football gods don't want me to watch this one"
hryinlw,2022-01-09 17:09:08,We have to score
hryinjr,2022-01-09 17:09:08,Ray Ray is fucking garbage
hryinei,2022-01-09 17:09:06,"Oh shit, Najesus has returned"
hryina5,2022-01-09 17:09:05,Stop fucking throwing to Ray Ray
hryimoc,2022-01-09 17:08:59,Ray Ray man
hryimo9,2022-01-09 17:08:59,"Like, sexually?"
hryimdz,2022-01-09 17:08:56,Wentz is doing us so many favors!
hryimdd,2022-01-09 17:08:56,HE'S BACK!!
hryilwm,2022-01-09 17:08:52,Omg jaguars might pull this off. That will be my second favorite team if this happens
hryilnf,2022-01-09 17:08:49,"We have to win this Bens last ride, jags taking care of business, and we’re playing a rival who have basically no starters left"
hryil6s,2022-01-09 17:08:44,Najee selling all out to give this team a shot at the post-season. Kids already a true Steeler!
hryikxl,2022-01-09 17:08:42,"Although I’ve mentally prepared myself for this all week…

Is there really any better way to summarize Ben’s 18 years than for the Jags to win and Steelers to blow it?"
hryiktp,2022-01-09 17:08:40,"Yeah I mean I don't want to be petty (but I am), but that man had everything and threw it all away. Was pissed when he got a ring with Tampa as he just doesn't deserve one because of his attitude. So now I'm happy. And maybe I'm an asshole. But at least I'm not an Antonio Brownhole."
hryikn0,2022-01-09 17:08:39,I want burger
hryikgx,2022-01-09 17:08:37,NAJEE IS BACK
hryikfk,2022-01-09 17:08:37,Same bro😅
hryigow,2022-01-09 17:08:01,Air it out enough with the run game. Their weakness is the secondary it’s unbelievable we’re not attacking it
hryigmn,2022-01-09 17:08:00,I could call a better game than Matt Canada with the fucking NFL Blitz playbook. Fire this asshole the moment the season ends.
hryighg,2022-01-09 17:07:59,I kinda like White out of Arizona State. Has a little speed but is supposed to be a good pass catcher. A little change of pace from Harris. I dream they find a Willie Parker type to be an explosive play guy.
hryig95,2022-01-09 17:07:56,Does it matter?   He isn’t performing well
hryig5y,2022-01-09 17:07:55,The current defense combined with the Killer B’s offense would have won 3 Super Bowls
hryig5x,2022-01-09 17:07:55,It ain’t all on Snell. Trust me… I know… Snell isn’t Harris. But the line gotta do it’s job too.
hryig44,2022-01-09 17:07:55,Two 1 yard runs and a screen pass behind the line of scrimmage coming right up!
hryig39,2022-01-09 17:07:54,"Because we know claypool clearly can't catch any deep ball, despite his size smh"
hryig0z,2022-01-09 17:07:54,Harris in
hryifgz,2022-01-09 17:07:49,Elbow injury in first quarter
hryifal,2022-01-09 17:07:47,Palpatine: good gooooood
hryif5v,2022-01-09 17:07:45,Good job stomping the cousins in the east
hryieyu,2022-01-09 17:07:43,Sorry best I can do is Snell up the middle
hryienw,2022-01-09 17:07:41,"We're gonna blow this, aren't we?"
hryieio,2022-01-09 17:07:39,Najee!
hryiehl,2022-01-09 17:07:39,Yo imagine if you had Wentz right now. Yikes city.
hryie9o,2022-01-09 17:07:37,"I’d rather get an arm punt on 3rd down than having to punt on 4th

Start being aggressive dude"
hryie57,2022-01-09 17:07:35,Smh Ben do something
hryie4h,2022-01-09 17:07:35,"If we win we play at KC…ummm, are we sure we want to win this?"
hryidtv,2022-01-09 17:07:33,Left injured during the first drive.
hryidrf,2022-01-09 17:07:32,You hate to see it.
hryidm5,2022-01-09 17:07:31,I have zero faith in the offense to produce a TD. It’s all up to Bosgod to get us the win
hryid66,2022-01-09 17:07:26,I’m not even concerned with the Jags anymore. It’s down to our offense and that’s all
hryiaah,2022-01-09 17:06:59,"Well, they stalled it out with 2 Benny Snell runs, I wouldn't count on it."
hryia7g,2022-01-09 17:06:58,Thank you PA Bro!
hryia27,2022-01-09 17:06:57,Pull an Antonio Brown!
hryia22,2022-01-09 17:06:57,Thank you JagBros! Let’s get this fucking W
hryi9vx,2022-01-09 17:06:55,Slippery field so they might want to force a turnover
hryi9ix,2022-01-09 17:06:51,Wentz is bad
hryi9g7,2022-01-09 17:06:50,THANK YOU GOOD SIR
hryi9fw,2022-01-09 17:06:50,LFG JACKSONVILLE
hryi99c,2022-01-09 17:06:49,Thanks Piladelpia fan!
hryi8w5,2022-01-09 17:06:45,"Oh, and you’re the expert? 🤡"
hryi8s2,2022-01-09 17:06:44,"Cowboys fan coming in peace. Congrats to #90. Dude is a baller. As much as I love Parsons, he has my vote for DPOY."
hryi8og,2022-01-09 17:06:43,Reminds me of Vince Williams going at LJ Fort last year on Twitter when LJ asked how they were gonna play Renegade with no fans. Williams telling him he'll find a way to play it at Away games too.
hryi8e7,2022-01-09 17:06:40,Ha! Could you imagine having a bad punt!!!!
hryi8du,2022-01-09 17:06:40,Colts are falling apart lol
hryi88r,2022-01-09 17:06:39,H
hryi871,2022-01-09 17:06:38,I swear this game is a race to the bottom
hryi86t,2022-01-09 17:06:38,"True. At least it wasn’t a toss sweep lol. But with that line and Snell, I don’t know what to call there, maybe to D Watt?"
hryi86c,2022-01-09 17:06:38,Ok we got a little momentum now
hryi7q3,2022-01-09 17:06:34,We NEED a TD now
hryi7o2,2022-01-09 17:06:33,Wentz just threw a pick lol
hryi7cy,2022-01-09 17:06:30,Great field position. We can easily throw it 6 yards behind LoS each play!
hryi72c,2022-01-09 17:06:27,I want taco
hryi6tg,2022-01-09 17:06:25,What happened to Harris?
hryi3d8,2022-01-09 17:05:51,Colts picked off again!
hryi39r,2022-01-09 17:05:50,those dump off we love doing so much on 3rd and 10 would actually be great for 3rd and 1. Canada has to come to terms with the fact that we have almost zero chance of converting short yardage on the ground
hryi34c,2022-01-09 17:05:48,Mr Punter sir that’s our schtick tyvm
hryi2po,2022-01-09 17:05:44,The Jags have another INT. Man
hryi2or,2022-01-09 17:05:44,Who else?
hryi2lh,2022-01-09 17:05:43,please score you motherfuckers
hryi2j4,2022-01-09 17:05:42,Ian Eagle a savage
hryi2id,2022-01-09 17:05:42,He Presslied it!
hryi1vz,2022-01-09 17:05:36,Yes and chargers can't tie
hryi150,2022-01-09 17:05:28,Fuck it. Fake it.
hryi0yi,2022-01-09 17:05:27,I really don't think Najee would fare much better. This line is playing bad by their own standards.
hryi0xs,2022-01-09 17:05:26,Shank
hryi0qa,2022-01-09 17:05:24,Maybe he is blind and we don’t know it? Vision of bat
hryi0o7,2022-01-09 17:05:24,Back up QBs are kryptonite.
hryi03c,2022-01-09 17:05:18,Yeah. Instead it was a yard behind the line to gain.
hryhzum,2022-01-09 17:05:16,Jacksonville showing the fuck up today and we're just hoping the defense can keep us in this long enough to reach the 4th quarter when our offense will finally get to work.
hryhwff,2022-01-09 17:04:41,I’m expecting the worst so that I can’t be disappointed.
hryhweu,2022-01-09 17:04:41,TJ just threw #85 😂
hryhw1d,2022-01-09 17:04:37,And no tie Sunday night
hryhvvr,2022-01-09 17:04:35,Can some play Renegade at the stadium please?
hryhvpy,2022-01-09 17:04:34,Can he just pass it? Just audible a fake?
hryhvij,2022-01-09 17:04:31,Yeah exactly - we put a lot of faith and promise in the guy and he just seems like....disinterested on the field. Stands out most plays - in a bad way.
hryhvbz,2022-01-09 17:04:30,Wondering the same thing. That injury looked nasty on the replay.
hryhva0,2022-01-09 17:04:29,FB watt 😂
hryhv3f,2022-01-09 17:04:27,I love how everyone is like “He’s legit nuts!” now rather than “Tomlin can’t control the locker room!”
hryhv34,2022-01-09 17:04:27,"So on top of some O-Line improvement, I think we also need to spend a 4-6 round pick on a RB.  Benny ain't it man."
hryhuuj,2022-01-09 17:04:25,Watt please I need you to scoop and score
hryhutw,2022-01-09 17:04:25,"Also claypool, but please no ray ray

Edit: also muth"
hryhuk6,2022-01-09 17:04:22,"Yea the line is terrible, Snell is too. So it comes down to play calling. Call something that has a shot."
hryhuft,2022-01-09 17:04:21,Pls don’t.
hryhu5t,2022-01-09 17:04:18,"Please win Pittsburg. 

-Eagles fan"
hryhu0p,2022-01-09 17:04:16,You mean you don't want to hear about how a team that should've only won 6 games didn't win a playoff game and it's an indictment on Tomlin for not taking them to the Super Bowl?
hryht7y,2022-01-09 17:04:08,Snell only knows how to run in a straight line.  That's the difference.  He also is done on contact.
hryht4z,2022-01-09 17:04:08,I have no idea how you can defend Snell...
hryhsrj,2022-01-09 17:04:04,It looks so bad but anything to involve the kids ig
hryhsm5,2022-01-09 17:04:02,Commentators ribbing on Antonio Brown makes me happy.
hryhpkm,2022-01-09 17:03:32,Nah. We can root Miami later if that happens
hryhpet,2022-01-09 17:03:31,"Was a good drive, hopefully that was all the proof we needed to abandon the run game"
hryhpen,2022-01-09 17:03:31,Every kickoff gets taken back to the 40 lmao. 10 yards to Tucker range
hryhpbb,2022-01-09 17:03:30,Pit really needed a TD that last drive. We were moving the ball better than any point this game.  I hope we don't sputter out.
hryhp67,2022-01-09 17:03:28,It's almost like Watt is an elite run defender so that doesn't work when he's in...
hryhow1,2022-01-09 17:03:26,He does crumple so fast. He doesn’t seem weak either! I remember watching him play at KT in a bowl vs my alma matter PSU (we lost) and he looked pretty good against a solid PSU defense. I thought he was gonna be a sick grab for Steelers but my grandma gardens harder than he runs
hryhonz,2022-01-09 17:03:23,"Going to lose to the ravens backup qb in a win and in situation, just total organizational incompetence. Should be fucking ashamed"
hryhoid,2022-01-09 17:03:22,It makes me wanna bash his against a wall too
hryho8j,2022-01-09 17:03:19,"I get some want to make it to playoffs for Ben. I get it.

But they are truly ONE AND DONE."
hryho3b,2022-01-09 17:03:17,Our kick coverage is looking really bad.
hryhnxt,2022-01-09 17:03:16,😂😂😂
hryhnbj,2022-01-09 17:03:10,"We would most likely play KC. I love TJ just as much as the next guy, but I don’t wanna watch that game again"
hryhn65,2022-01-09 17:03:08,D is basically going to have to win this game
hryhn2r,2022-01-09 17:03:07,"I'm rooting for the Colts now. Fuck it. At least keep the Rat Birds out, too."
hryhmwq,2022-01-09 17:03:06,12 carries for 22 yards
hryhmtl,2022-01-09 17:03:05,“It’s not snells fault” 12 carries for 22 yards
hryhmt7,2022-01-09 17:03:05,Surely we could change up the playcalling when when Benny Snell has had as much of a presence as abstinence in a brothel
hryhmr9,2022-01-09 17:03:04,gotta move on from Canada. Possibly Butler as well.
hryhidg,2022-01-09 17:02:22,It's 3rd and 1. It''s supposed to be a HB Dive and you trust your line to move the pile. The line failed to do that there. And I say that as someone who hates all the excuses people say about our oline.
hryhhgd,2022-01-09 17:02:13,Canada’s playcalling makes me want bash my head against a wall. Jesus.
hryhh48,2022-01-09 17:02:09,"Injured early. Hurt his arm on a tackle in the first. Was listed as probable, but hasn’t been in yet."
hryhh2r,2022-01-09 17:02:09,"Everyone in here is blaming Snell when it's not his fault. Snell and Najee both have the same problems facing them. Terrible play calls, no open slots to run through, terrible o line."
hryhh2d,2022-01-09 17:02:09,Part of me wants us to get into the PO's but we'll be 1 and done so is there a point?
hryhgi1,2022-01-09 17:02:03,I heard probable…but that was pretty much right after it happened. Don’t look good
hryhgg1,2022-01-09 17:02:03,Why is that guy reaching for a towel while still all suds'd up?
hryhg9v,2022-01-09 17:02:01,Just keep pounding Snell against the #1 rush defense. That ought to work.
hryhg4v,2022-01-09 17:02:00,Absolutely ridiculous. We’d have more effect with Ben diving through the middle after taking the snap.
hryhg4a,2022-01-09 17:02:00,Imagine scoring a touchdown in a must-win game
hryhfuf,2022-01-09 17:01:57,I was wondering the same thing.
hryhflq,2022-01-09 17:01:54,"Even if he can't hold the ball, he'd still be better than Benny"
hryhfjx,2022-01-09 17:01:54,So Najee is done for the game? Has it been confirmed?
hryhfjn,2022-01-09 17:01:54,It’s wild! Idk what he is thinking. game after game too
hryhfdh,2022-01-09 17:01:52,He’s out
hryhc25,2022-01-09 17:01:20,"Hurt arm like first series on a reception attempt, hasn't played since"
hryhbzv,2022-01-09 17:01:19,Canada has the most predictable play calling in the NFL
hryhbxv,2022-01-09 17:01:19,Injured his elbow early
hryhbv1,2022-01-09 17:01:18,Ray ray isn’t bad. Snell is worse than taco at RB
hryhbup,2022-01-09 17:01:18,Hot drive with the passing game on fire? Put the ball in Benny's hands repeatedly 🤡
hryhbtp,2022-01-09 17:01:18,You’re really late. He got hurt first drive.
hryhbpg,2022-01-09 17:01:16,STOP RUNNING THE BALL. This gameplan is atrocious
hryhbl8,2022-01-09 17:01:15,We're you ready for an overthrow into the back of the endzone instead of points?
hryhbl1,2022-01-09 17:01:15,"Fuck Matt Canada. Let's get in the next offensive assistant coach to save $$$  

Fuck you Art"
hryhbkl,2022-01-09 17:01:15,Injured
hryhbj1,2022-01-09 17:01:15,Are they purposely not saying anything about Najee? No way we win without him. If he comes back for the 4th we got this.
hryhbf2,2022-01-09 17:01:13,We won’t lol
hryhb9r,2022-01-09 17:01:12,Our oline is soft as tissue paper.
hryhb8y,2022-01-09 17:01:12,Fuck that. We’re trying to win a game we deserve to lose
hryhb54,2022-01-09 17:01:11,He's garbage. Supposed goal line back can't gain a fucking yard.
hryhb03,2022-01-09 17:01:09,Lmao the Line can't get any push and Ben is carving up their secondary so let's stall a drive with 2 Benny Snell iso runs!! Always a great idea
hryhavf,2022-01-09 17:01:08,Watching the handoff to Snell was painful. You could just tell he wasn’t gonna get it.
hryhars,2022-01-09 17:01:07,No I said the same thing he runs like 3 yards backwards when he's turning around after a catch
hryhaik,2022-01-09 17:01:05,But yet what do we do
hryha7w,2022-01-09 17:01:02,Just make Claypool our RB

Just a reminder that a lot of y'all said you would absolutely take this scenario...(also just wanna brag on my kinda prophetic dream)"
hryh9x2,2022-01-09 17:00:59,Najee must really be hurt
hryh9p2,2022-01-09 17:00:57,I feel like I can’t even blame snell there was absolutely zero room to run the ball there
hryh9ns,2022-01-09 17:00:56,I don’t have the stats on me but I imagine the hit rate on 7th round picks is very low.
hryh9km,2022-01-09 17:00:56,Bellichick last year
hryh9jc,2022-01-09 17:00:55,Benny snell is so so bad. Why don’t we ever QB sneak?
hryh9ic,2022-01-09 17:00:55,Snell is honestly terrible
hryh9fu,2022-01-09 17:00:54,I don't understand why they don't run Derek Watt on those short plays.
hryh9fi,2022-01-09 17:00:54,Could of just sneaked it
hryh9af,2022-01-09 17:00:53,Madness
hryh96p,2022-01-09 17:00:52,God this team fucking sucks
hryh94g,2022-01-09 17:00:51,Need a big defensive stop here ravens are gaining momentum
hryh934,2022-01-09 17:00:51,Why are we running through stacked boxes this is pathetic
hryh8zw,2022-01-09 17:00:50,"Yeah, Najee would probably get stuffed on that same play. Our o-line went backwards."
hryh8zr,2022-01-09 17:00:50,PUT THE FULLBACK IN AND RUN IT UP THE MIDDLE. CANADA IS TERRIBLE.
hryh8z2,2022-01-09 17:00:50,Two more of those from the Bosgod and we’re back in it boys
hryh8us,2022-01-09 17:00:49,Why on earth would you try to run when it hasn’t worked all day
hryh8q3,2022-01-09 17:00:47,Living in our fears 101
hryh8l1,2022-01-09 17:00:46,"Not mad at that. Big stop here and it’s game on!!!

FIRE UP"
hryh8km,2022-01-09 17:00:46,He’s been stopped plenty of times
hryh8jx,2022-01-09 17:00:46,and put who in? LOL
hryh8h0,2022-01-09 17:00:45,Why in the FUCK do they keep giving Snell the fucking ball!
hryh8cr,2022-01-09 17:00:44,"I can’t take this. Jags holding their end of the bargain and our offense is shitting the bed.

Story of the season"
hryh8bf,2022-01-09 17:00:43,Yes lets keep going to snell
hryh8aq,2022-01-09 17:00:43,Snell into the pile with no vision. Typical
hryh5hs,2022-01-09 17:00:17,Jaguars really are beating the colts lol. They weren't lowing when they said colts haven't beaten jaguars at home in the last 12 games. I guess they really have their number. Probably know what they usually run and how they play I guess.
hryh5cq,2022-01-09 17:00:15,"Steelers against the Browns terrible run defense: let’s throw the ball 50 fucking times

hryh55d,2022-01-09 17:00:14,MAN HOW FUCKING OBVIOUS CAN YOU MAKE A PLAY CALL
hryh4vj,2022-01-09 17:00:11,Because he gave absolutely no attempt at getting the first down. His priority is always avoiding contact.
hryh4ua,2022-01-09 17:00:11,I'm so tired of these spots. I dont see how that ball was spotted almost a yard short of the sticks
hryh4t2,2022-01-09 17:00:10,Najee going down first drive pretty much fucked us today. Like basically we have to just throw every play now even third and 1.
hryh4iu,2022-01-09 17:00:08,We need a backup RB
hryh4hf,2022-01-09 17:00:07,"Offense was moving that drive, so hopefully that means Ben turned off his headset lmao"
hryh4dd,2022-01-09 17:00:06,I think we need to focus on getting Snell to the outside. He’s not making any headway up the middle.
hryh43u,2022-01-09 17:00:04,[deleted]
hryh3uk,2022-01-09 17:00:01,Who here actually thought Snell would get that?
hryh3qh,2022-01-09 17:00:00,"Dude run a play action there of course they are gonna sell it on the run.
That’s not Najee back there"
hryh3p7,2022-01-09 17:00:00,Insanity
hryh3l8,2022-01-09 16:59:59,Why are we running without Najee in critical situations?
hryh3jn,2022-01-09 16:59:58,"Wonderful play calling, 3rd n 1 run it up the middle with our great OL"
hryh3ix,2022-01-09 16:59:58,Can't even run 1 fucking yard. Fucking pathetic
hryh3i7,2022-01-09 16:59:58,Matt Canada is terrible
hryh39u,2022-01-09 16:59:56,"Go for it. Can’t get a yard, you don’t deserve to win"
hryh34p,2022-01-09 16:59:54,Ironic with the jags being Ben's kryptonite in the playoffs
hryh312,2022-01-09 16:59:53,"Snell is too small, too weak, and uncreative.  Yet we throw him up the middle to the same predictable result."
hryh2xi,2022-01-09 16:59:52,Stop running the ball on the #1 rush defense in the league wtf
hryh2rx,2022-01-09 16:59:50,And hb dives
hryh2qu,2022-01-09 16:59:50,BENNY SNELL AND CANADA JUST WALK OUT OF THE STADIUM goodbye!!!!!!
hryh2qc,2022-01-09 16:59:50,At least Presley can hold the ball
hryh2q0,2022-01-09 16:59:50,This is a terrible decision.
hryh2ps,2022-01-09 16:59:50,"its not even snells fault, no one can run behind a oline that cant get any push"
hryh2mr,2022-01-09 16:59:49,Sneak that shit what's the worst that can happen? This is supposed to be Ben's last game
hryh2lp,2022-01-09 16:59:49,[deleted]
hryh2ks,2022-01-09 16:59:49,We need to stop the fucking run…
hryh2iz,2022-01-09 16:59:48,Just fucking classic
hryh2fl,2022-01-09 16:59:47,"Please tell Snell that he needs to run away from the pile, not into the middle of it."
hryh2dt,2022-01-09 16:59:47,It was obvious we were going up the middle with our 140 pound running back.  Bad call. It's almost always a bad call for us to pound the middle with Snell or even Najee with our O line.
hryh28r,2022-01-09 16:59:45,Stop. Fucking. Giving. Smell. The. Ball.
hryh233,2022-01-09 16:59:44,Oh he’s under protocols? Tragic

hryh1nh,2022-01-09 16:59:40,Mike 3 points Tomlin
hrygz8g,2022-01-09 16:59:15,HOW DOES AN OFFENSIVE LINE SUCK SO FUCKING BAD
hrygz50,2022-01-09 16:59:14,How was DJ short?
hrygz3z,2022-01-09 16:59:14,Why no QB sneak.
hrygykc,2022-01-09 16:59:08,"Surely, at some point Canada will realize going up the middle isn’t working"
hrygyj1,2022-01-09 16:59:08,Can't even get a fucking yard. So pathetic.
hrygyf3,2022-01-09 16:59:07,Holy fuck we cannot run the ball
hrygyer,2022-01-09 16:59:07,Unreal
hrygy77,2022-01-09 16:59:05,Fawk
hrygy58,2022-01-09 16:59:04,"Is it me, but does D Johnson seem to go backwards after almost every catch? From a full curl out to just a stutter step. Just always a little backward motion. Maybe I’m crazy."
hrygxwf,2022-01-09 16:59:02,i fucking hate benny smell
hrygxly,2022-01-09 16:58:59,I love the urgency in the offense on this drive.  Good on Ben for getting this group organized this drive.
hrygx1i,2022-01-09 16:58:53,Omfg
hrygw5s,2022-01-09 16:58:45,He might pop a knee joint
hrygw14,2022-01-09 16:58:44,“Jimmy Smith there to greet him”
hrygvkd,2022-01-09 16:58:39,Either it’s a corps that doesn’t listen - they all do it to some degree- or yet another area where coaching has failed completely.
hrygvfa,2022-01-09 16:58:38,Holy shit the Colts are gonna lose to Jacksonville. We have a chance
hrygs5q,2022-01-09 16:58:07,What was the chant? Anyone know?
hrygs0r,2022-01-09 16:58:05,Snell is lucky he's good at special teams because he brings nothing to the offense.
hrygrwr,2022-01-09 16:58:04,literally stop running!!!!!!!!
hrygrko,2022-01-09 16:58:01,Maybe we should line him up at RB…
hrygreh,2022-01-09 16:57:59,Johnson caught it! Johnson didn't run back three yards before going upfield! Looking up!
hrygr80,2022-01-09 16:57:58,Scared to death for Ben during play action
hrygqt4,2022-01-09 16:57:54,SAY IT WITH ME: SECOND HALF TEAM
hrygqqo,2022-01-09 16:57:53,Why do these idiots wait so long to get going
hrygqn6,2022-01-09 16:57:52,FUUUUUYEAHHHHH
hrygqk4,2022-01-09 16:57:51,HOW FUCKING HARD IS THAT
hrygqh3,2022-01-09 16:57:50,Good job offense. Let tj get all the rest.
hrygqba,2022-01-09 16:57:49,Probably true. It’s a shame Favre played dead for Strahan so he could beat the record and Harbaugh‘s gonna make it very difficult for watt
hrygpxb,2022-01-09 16:57:45,"As a jags fan, today we do it for Ben."
hrygpqr,2022-01-09 16:57:43,They should play Claypool in the slot
hrygpfu,2022-01-09 16:57:40,Stop running
hrygpd7,2022-01-09 16:57:40,Snell can’t run.
hrygp6p,2022-01-09 16:57:38,Pass to run at this point
hrygp0d,2022-01-09 16:57:36,"Claypool is built for football, sucks we couldn’t utilize him this season."
hryglw5,2022-01-09 16:57:05,Jiontae Dohnson
hryglq6,2022-01-09 16:57:03,Bad Wentz is out in full force. Let’s not wait till the 4th to start playing.

Hard to say since your average Ravens fan can't read..."
hrygkmj,2022-01-09 16:56:53,*Why does Diontae run backwards
hrygki6,2022-01-09 16:56:51,Screw it use Claypool as RB1 lol
hrygkg0,2022-01-09 16:56:51,Totally expected a strip fumble on that Claypoop run.
hrygk4d,2022-01-09 16:56:48,Wow attacking their secondary works
hrygk2l,2022-01-09 16:56:47,Thank you Mapletron
hrygk1j,2022-01-09 16:56:47,"yeah he's worse than Artie Burns or Jarvis Jones for me. We traded up for this guy, and desperately needed him to replace Shazier. Missing on a middle linebacker for the steelers is almost as bad as missing on a QB"
hrygjxj,2022-01-09 16:56:46,diontae Johnson loves to catch a ball for eight yards and turn it backward for a gain of five yards.
hrygjv9,2022-01-09 16:56:45,We are down one touchdown dude calm down
hrygjq7,2022-01-09 16:56:44,WHY DID WE START RUNNING BACKWARDS
hrygj2l,2022-01-09 16:56:38,Dj always running backwards
hrygi7n,2022-01-09 16:56:29,"There we go, Chase."
hrygi4l,2022-01-09 16:56:28,Jax just picked off wentz
hryge3d,2022-01-09 16:55:48,UGH
hrygdwe,2022-01-09 16:55:46,Why do WR run backwards after catching the ball!?
hrygdqu,2022-01-09 16:55:45,Faster than the speed of smell.  Benny Snell.
hrygdp7,2022-01-09 16:55:44,Wrong way Diontae
hrygdod,2022-01-09 16:55:44,"Cmon boys we can do this

Ride and die with this fucking team, lfg"
hrygdje,2022-01-09 16:55:43,A miracle dose of some Benny Snell Football will be what takes us to the playoffs
hrygdib,2022-01-09 16:55:43,DJ runs backwards every time he gets the ball. He’s scared to hit
hrygdfd,2022-01-09 16:55:42,"A pass beyond the line

how is that even possible"
hrygdat,2022-01-09 16:55:41,Diontae sprinting backwards
hrygcye,2022-01-09 16:55:37,They just went untouched for 46 yards…we can’t go untouched for 1 yard.
hrygcw8,2022-01-09 16:55:37,Clearly we need more QB designed runs
hrygcs4,2022-01-09 16:55:35,Maybe if they didn’t exert all that energy on that little LARP activity they decided to partake in with the Fitzpatrick “interception” they’d have enough energy to stop that TD
hrygcjf,2022-01-09 16:55:33,Enjoy your jerk and nap.
hrygchz,2022-01-09 16:55:33,Just Tomlin things.
hrygcg4,2022-01-09 16:55:32,Diontae.  FORWARD AT ALL COSTS.  PLEASE AND THANK YOU.
hrygcf2,2022-01-09 16:55:32,Diontae needs to learn to just turn up field
hrygc59,2022-01-09 16:55:29,Is there another way?
hrygbz5,2022-01-09 16:55:27,Why is DJ incapable of just running forward jfc
hrygby3,2022-01-09 16:55:27,Chase Claypool is literally just a body this game...
hrygb5r,2022-01-09 16:55:19,Please offense do something I beg
hryg8p3,2022-01-09 16:54:55,If the Steelers are going to lose I’d rather the Colts win to keep the ratbirds out

hryg6we,2022-01-09 16:54:37,I agree
hryg6s2,2022-01-09 16:54:36,Just once I'd like to see McLeod run one back
hryg6qd,2022-01-09 16:54:36,Lions ahead of the Packers and we can’t even beat the Ravens??
hryg6m5,2022-01-09 16:54:35,Would be a great story if Pittsburgh gets in and miraculously wins it all for Ben's final season.
hryg6h4,2022-01-09 16:54:33,Really makes you think smh… /s
hryg6ar,2022-01-09 16:54:31,"Dude, poor Minkah. Bush puts him in so many bad spots."
hryg64t,2022-01-09 16:54:30,Let's go Ray Ray football time
hryg5yi,2022-01-09 16:54:28,If all results held it would be Mahomes hanging 50 on this defense.
hryg5hg,2022-01-09 16:54:23,What about how the offense has played today make you think they’re capable of scoring a TD?? Arguably their best player on offense is out to boot.
hryg5c9,2022-01-09 16:54:22,"Run, run, forced pass to McCloud"
hryg5b5,2022-01-09 16:54:22,That's not fabulous.
hryg5a0,2022-01-09 16:54:21,He's been ok with this all season
hryg53p,2022-01-09 16:54:19,Lol right.  Idk what I was thinking lol
hryg50u,2022-01-09 16:54:19,Is Big Snack still in NT shape?  I feel so demoralized anytime I see a big run up the gut.
hryg2ha,2022-01-09 16:53:52,if I'm Harbaugh I probably throw it like five times the rest of this game
hryg1wg,2022-01-09 16:53:46,I don’t think they want it. It just comes down to that. I don’t see it. Watt and Heyward do. Not sure about others
hryg1pz,2022-01-09 16:53:45,"Pretty much this, how is there not a fucking QB spy on third down?"
hryg1ow,2022-01-09 16:53:44,"RIP. Classic Tomlin. Season on the line, come out and gameplan and play like shit."
hryg1ol,2022-01-09 16:53:44,Literally makes me want to die
hryg1jw,2022-01-09 16:53:43,Let’s see if this offense can manage to get a first down
hryg0um,2022-01-09 16:53:36,This is the way
hryg0mi,2022-01-09 16:53:34,2nd half offense is about to go into effect don't worry
hryg0ew,2022-01-09 16:53:32,Yea he’s gotta dig real deep here
hryg08d,2022-01-09 16:53:30,Classic Steelers if we win
hryg06y,2022-01-09 16:53:30,Imagine imagine if these purple ratbirds are going into playoffs🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
hryg06v,2022-01-09 16:53:30,The Jags really are gonna win and we are gonna lose. The pain never stops
hryg06b,2022-01-09 16:53:30,My thoughts exactly but that's steelers football
hryg05v,2022-01-09 16:53:30,I was wondering the same thing.
hryg00w,2022-01-09 16:53:28,I’m dead 😂
hryfzy4,2022-01-09 16:53:28,"I mean once they announced the backup QB was starting our chances of winning went down like 30%, then once Jax started winning it dropped another 30%. No one should be surprised"
hryfzvd,2022-01-09 16:53:27,It's almost like our Expected Win-Loss was 6-11 so being in this position s playing with house money..
hryfzos,2022-01-09 16:53:25,From shotgun
hryfzko,2022-01-09 16:53:24,I do!
hryfzj2,2022-01-09 16:53:23,So that bens last playoff game isn’t a blowout loss to the browns. Yes
hryfzh8,2022-01-09 16:53:23,"Sorry, too many shots"
hryfzg9,2022-01-09 16:53:23,coulda parked a jumbo jet in that fucking hole. holy fuck we're really gonna blow this.
hryfzd6,2022-01-09 16:53:22,Pit mustve gotten word that Jax is leading against Indy so they forgot about winning their own game to get in. Still time though gents.
hryfzbw,2022-01-09 16:53:21,I do appreciate our team giving us the 2022 season preview by showing us what level of play to expect
hryfzbb,2022-01-09 16:53:21,"People going on and on about Harvin but in reality if Ben keeps it up the biggest issue is not pulling him. 

I'm just hoping for a Colts comeback to make it all moot. We're not winning this with #7."
hryfz92,2022-01-09 16:53:21,Remember when we all made the 8-8-1 jokes like 2 months ago
hryfz5t,2022-01-09 16:53:20,Bro have you watch the office today? Though I could use a blunt
hryfz0i,2022-01-09 16:53:18,Majority of players on our defense are soft.
hryfyxs,2022-01-09 16:53:18,Agreeed
hryfyuk,2022-01-09 16:53:17,To what throw a 2yd out
hryfvyv,2022-01-09 16:52:48,Yeah it’s not like we’ve had 7 straight punts
hryfvvy,2022-01-09 16:52:47,Nah I’m good
hryfvns,2022-01-09 16:52:45,Devin Bush cannot be starting next year. Absolutely terrible player
hryfvcv,2022-01-09 16:52:42,Back to Snell up the middle.
hryfv3c,2022-01-09 16:52:39,We might as well be down 50
hryfuwi,2022-01-09 16:52:37,Itd be fun to make the playoffs but do we really want to play KC in KC again?
hryfurc,2022-01-09 16:52:36,I just want tj to get the record.
hryfuku,2022-01-09 16:52:34,Devin bush just doesn't even give a shit that a dude like Patrick queen is better than him. lol
hryfubi,2022-01-09 16:52:31,Jags gonna win and we’re doing this
hryfu7z,2022-01-09 16:52:30,Can we play offense yet. Tomlin saying at half we need splash plays in the run game makes me think he is a dumbass. We have had 1 game this season running the ball
hryfu7j,2022-01-09 16:52:30,Lmao so on one play Spillane runs right into his own DLineman getting blocked leaving the gap wide open and on the next Bush is nowhere to found allowing a 30 yard walk in TD
hryftqc,2022-01-09 16:52:25,But we could kick like 3 field goals ya know
hryftor,2022-01-09 16:52:25,This is definitely a Mike Tomlin led team. Just enough to be mediocre for the season and call it a non losing season.
hryftnn,2022-01-09 16:52:25,Oh I equally blame both.
hryftks,2022-01-09 16:52:24,"Man Minkah actually just said fuck it, holy shit"
hryftcn,2022-01-09 16:52:22,I hope the colts end up winning if we lose
hryft4b,2022-01-09 16:52:20,Devin Bush is just nightmare fuel at this point
hryft41,2022-01-09 16:52:20,This isn’t good.
hryfsvx,2022-01-09 16:52:17,Yo they're down by a TD hit a blunt and chill tf out
hryfst0,2022-01-09 16:52:17,"No argument there, but I think both sides have forgotten."
hryfsox,2022-01-09 16:52:15,Insurmountable lead
hryfso3,2022-01-09 16:52:15,Don't worry guys our high Octane offense will keep us in this 🥴
hryfsjm,2022-01-09 16:52:14,Way to easy.
hryfsj6,2022-01-09 16:52:14,Third and out on a 2yd screen incoming
hryfs4i,2022-01-09 16:52:09,Steelers offense: I will never financially recover from this
hryfs33,2022-01-09 16:52:09,Yeah Burrow would hang 50 on this defense anyway
hryfs0d,2022-01-09 16:52:08,Okay Ben. Your time.
hryfot2,2022-01-09 16:51:37,Jags winning just for us to lose is so hilariously Steelers
hryfor1,2022-01-09 16:51:36,Defensive touchdown?
hryfopj,2022-01-09 16:51:36,The raiders and chargers are going to tie so they both get in
hryfoku,2022-01-09 16:51:34,Our guys are literally jogging ahead of them when he runs by them they just don't do s***
hryfojf,2022-01-09 16:51:34,Damn that looked easy
hryfoj5,2022-01-09 16:51:34,"Anytime a door opens up for them by other teams, they abruptly slam it shut."
hryfoie,2022-01-09 16:51:34,Shoutout to all the people here who really thought out season would come down to the Jags game and assumed we’d win this one.
hryfo38,2022-01-09 16:51:30,steelers moment
hryfo0w,2022-01-09 16:51:29,"Lol. Perfect opportunity to make the playoffs, but they choke. I’m just rooting for a shit ton more T.J. Watt sacks"

hryfnef,2022-01-09 16:51:23,Way to fire up the team Tomlin.

hryfmac,2022-01-09 16:51:12,I miss Alualu and Tuitt so bad man
hryfm82,2022-01-09 16:51:11,No way can we score 7 so this game is effectively over
hryfm7a,2022-01-09 16:51:11,Maybe it’s better if we don’t make the playoffs lol
hryflpm,2022-01-09 16:51:06,This is gonna be a heartbreaking afternoon

hryflal,2022-01-09 16:51:02,"That's probably game, no QB no running game. Don't see how they score"
hryfl9c,2022-01-09 16:51:02,well they did a good job at forcing him up the middle. it’s just that no one was there

Honestly, I don't see how you or anyone could possible think we can win a playoff game (obviously any given sunday....) considering we've had 17 weeks of games and have NOT played well/decent for 4 consecutive quarters once this season. Seems insane to me to suggest that we would suddenly buck that trend."
hryewwz,2022-01-09 16:46:58,His collar was thinking about Watt getting another sack. Just a little over starched!
hryewlg,2022-01-09 16:46:55,Kinda sad that Baltimore is playing an undrafted backup and he’s clearly the best QB in this game so far. Hopefully that changes…
hryewlb,2022-01-09 16:46:55,We're play their backup QB and a depleted defense.  We *should* win this game.

2. Number 1 rush defense who is not afraid of our noodle arm QB"
hrydtjp,2022-01-09 16:40:35,WENTZ GOT STRIP SACKED
hrydt99,2022-01-09 16:40:32,He has a qb. He doesn't have a line. But his approach is inexcusable. Get out of the Burgh
hrydt7i,2022-01-09 16:40:32,Jags sack. Near instant redzone!
hrydsf3,2022-01-09 16:40:24,JAGS RECOVERED FUMBLE
hryds82,2022-01-09 16:40:22,JAGUARS RECOVER SACK FUMBLE!!!!
hrydrn0,2022-01-09 16:40:16,Could we beat out the colts with two ties or nah?
hrydrhx,2022-01-09 16:40:15,Hurt his wrist on a 4yd pass.
hrydnyc,2022-01-09 16:39:40,"Guys we are a second half team, lucky our defense has stepped up so far let’s fucking win this"
hrydnuv,2022-01-09 16:39:39,"Oh, I hadn’t heard that — thank you!"
hrydn9s,2022-01-09 16:39:33,"You're aware the wheels have fallen of our QB right?

Like I love Ben, but he's done. Hard to assess an OC."
hrydn8b,2022-01-09 16:39:33,Might as well take a swig of it while you're at it. Might make the second half easier to watch
hrydmwl,2022-01-09 16:39:30,"Lot of people saying Waitman has Covid, does anyone have an actual source on that? Everything I’ve seen says he’s available but they gave Harvin the helmet."
hrydlqg,2022-01-09 16:39:18,"Ya, apparently the fumble makes him a runner. Not saying it makes sense, but apparently that’s the rule."
hrydkvb,2022-01-09 16:39:08,Why score lot points when few points do trick?
hrydgdi,2022-01-09 16:38:23,Ravens
hrydf6d,2022-01-09 16:38:11,It was ruled an aborted play.
hrydf0l,2022-01-09 16:38:10,"My friend, we could have Bill Walsh running the offense and we'd be shite with this line and QB. Especially with Najee hurt."
hrydezc,2022-01-09 16:38:09,"Na jags win raiders or chargers win, and Steelers Ravens tie lol"
hrydevz,2022-01-09 16:38:08,37 but close enough 😂
hryde1r,2022-01-09 16:38:00,I think it was only 38 yards actually lol
hrydajf,2022-01-09 16:37:26,It would be so Steelers if the jags win then we win then the raiders and chargers tie
hrydacr,2022-01-09 16:37:24,T Law is on fire today😂
hryd9j5,2022-01-09 16:37:16,"Exactly, no issues though he will have 28 next season"
hryd93e,2022-01-09 16:37:11,"Huntley reestablished possession after the bad snap. Like I said, TJ was credited with a forced fumble on the play so I don’t know how it’s not counted as a sack as well. I guess they just have him a regular TFL"
hryd8zh,2022-01-09 16:37:10,Lol wtf does PFF have against TJ? I remember seeing [this article](https://www.pff.com/news/nfl-aaron-donald-los-angeles-rams-defensive-player-of-the-year-2022) a few days ago.
hryd3pe,2022-01-09 16:36:17,Browns are holding off Bengals.
hryd3b4,2022-01-09 16:36:13,najee busted that one long run last week against the browns that if i remember correctly went for 40
hryd2rv,2022-01-09 16:36:08,We are a fourth quarter team!! A tie at half is basically a win.
hryd2pw,2022-01-09 16:36:07,That Detroit play was awesome
hryd1os,2022-01-09 16:35:57,It's all TJ and sacks today.
hrycxt5,2022-01-09 16:35:18,Yeah it’s just the idiots who believe PFF saying that “WEEK 18 RECORDS DO NOT COUNT” Little do they know that Watt has really only played 13-15 full games and has left many games early… fuck em
hrycxd7,2022-01-09 16:35:13,Only if the Steelers win.  Otherwise I want to Colts to win to keep the Ravens out.
hrycxbr,2022-01-09 16:35:13,Have we had a play over like 40 yards this year? I legitimately don't think we have
hrycwzn,2022-01-09 16:35:09,Who gives a fuck what they think. Fuck the haters
hrycwx3,2022-01-09 16:35:08,Replay shows Huntley’s knee drill his jewels. Definitely would make any man wince
hrycwsu,2022-01-09 16:35:07,Halftime.  Time to wash my eyes out with bleach after watching the 1st half offensive performance.
hrycwe2,2022-01-09 16:35:03,TJ took one to the sack.   Najee wasn't doing anything against the #1 run defense either.
hrycw8h,2022-01-09 16:35:02,Ah bummer.
hrycvdl,2022-01-09 16:34:53,3 players numb nuts.
hrycv7c,2022-01-09 16:34:51,Why do we have Harvin back in when Our other punter Waitman was wayyyy better
hrycuwv,2022-01-09 16:34:49,He's out with covid
hrycujn,2022-01-09 16:34:45,Anyone else want to be a fly on the wall in the locker room during halftime?
hrycu7e,2022-01-09 16:34:42,Looks like he got hit in the sack.
hrycu5i,2022-01-09 16:34:41,I came here to say this
hrycqoz,2022-01-09 16:34:07,He took huntleys knee to his balls. First drive wasn’t a sack because of the fumble prior to his tackle apparently. Wait man is on reserve Covid list.
hrycpzp,2022-01-09 16:34:00,"first one went down as an aborted play, second one is negated by flag"
hrycpvp,2022-01-09 16:33:59,Everybody giving TJ shit would absolutely kill to have him. Amazing stuff out there
hrycpm2,2022-01-09 16:33:56,Why do they hate our boy?
hrycphx,2022-01-09 16:33:55,"There's some idiots coming in here saying Strahan's record is more impressive because he did it in less games. This is TJ's 15th game, Strahan played all 16 in 2001. And then they argue that he had more chances to play like wtf..."
hrycp4h,2022-01-09 16:33:52,"TL is doing his part in Jacksonville, we really need to get our heads out of our asses and finish strong here. No excuses just grind out a fucking win!"
hrycp2h,2022-01-09 16:33:51,Fuck that
hrycp0f,2022-01-09 16:33:50,"Backup RB, but I feel you. Probably because of the rain and all our receivers have issues keeping their feet underneath them on the driest of days."
hrycoo0,2022-01-09 16:33:47,Yeah I'm confused on these too
hrycodh,2022-01-09 16:33:44,"Couple thoughts:
1) is watts injury the nagging groin or simple hit to the plums ?  
2) snell is a shell of his college self"
hryckhf,2022-01-09 16:33:06,[deleted]
hryck81,2022-01-09 16:33:03,18*
hryck26,2022-01-09 16:33:01,"The strip sack went down as an abandoned play, the penalty wiped out his .5"
hrycjz5,2022-01-09 16:33:01,A sack for a sack
hryciyo,2022-01-09 16:32:50,"If you told me that we would be tied and jags up 10 with 30 minutes of football left, I’d take that 10 times outta 10. About to get stressful as fuck"
hrycivp,2022-01-09 16:32:50,Yeah it’s low scoring like the old days but the level of play by both teams is much much worse than the old days
hrycits,2022-01-09 16:32:49,Whatever it takes
hrycit5,2022-01-09 16:32:49,"Ben is 8-16 for 66 yards and a pick. Honestly, I’m surprised it’s that good. We’re in week 17 and it still looks like the offense doesn’t practice during the week."
hrycik3,2022-01-09 16:32:47,Yeah but I guess you could say it isn’t the most common thing to have in football? Especially for skill positions. I’d probably only say you need to wear it on the line. But what do I know lol
hrychyq,2022-01-09 16:32:41,It's always good to have a chance! But yeah..
hrychnm,2022-01-09 16:32:38,"I hope so, because it clearly wasn’t on purpose"
hrychm1,2022-01-09 16:32:37,"hey now, sometimes... *interesting* stuff happens when rudolph plays."
hrychlh,2022-01-09 16:32:37,Did I miss something? Now they’re saying that Watt DID get the sack…
hrycehl,2022-01-09 16:32:05,Them
hryce7u,2022-01-09 16:32:03,In the replay you can see he took a knee to the nuts
hrycdxy,2022-01-09 16:32:00,"We wouldn’t make it in, has to be a win"
hrycdsl,2022-01-09 16:31:59,Uhhh hitting a woman down there is still going to hurt
hrycdhr,2022-01-09 16:31:56,Hail Mary WR screen
hrycdey,2022-01-09 16:31:55,I think us
hrycddz,2022-01-09 16:31:55,Balt
hrycczc,2022-01-09 16:31:51,Ratbirds
hryccyn,2022-01-09 16:31:50,"The fact they keep saying this is old school Ravens Steelers is really pissing me off

Our offense has the capability to drive down field but our OC is once again holding us back

Why are we running when our backup RB* is going against the #1 rush defense"
hryccv6,2022-01-09 16:31:50,"Well, things could certainly be worse than us being tied and the jags up by 10 lol"
hryccul,2022-01-09 16:31:49,That's only the fifth time that's happened this season lmao
hryccqy,2022-01-09 16:31:48,"You know what would really help them at the moment? The: Ben-throws-a-jump-ball-to-no-one-as-claypool-falls-backwards-with-a-40%-chance-of-catching-it.. play

Haven’t seen ‘ole Canada dial that one up yet"
hryccjt,2022-01-09 16:31:46,dont be ridiculous. huntley was still in the air when tj landed on his knee.
hrycchu,2022-01-09 16:31:46,I don’t really think a playoff game would mean anything to this team except Ben would get one more game. We would obviously lose it anyway.
hrycc6o,2022-01-09 16:31:43,Especially since it's looking like we'd have to go back to KC and we know what happened last time we were there. I'll pass on that as Ben's final game thank you. Lol
hrycc0n,2022-01-09 16:31:41,Ravens
hrycbak,2022-01-09 16:31:34,Time to let Ben call plays and have him lead us to win the game in the 2nd half like he tried to do against the Chargers and Vikings. He obviously isn’t playing that well but he does play better in the 2nd half as long as our OLINE can somewhat protect him. No Najee is a killer tho
hryc8na,2022-01-09 16:31:08,Great dude. Not sure if off field life is impacting him. Hope the best for him but he is definitely gonna be playing for his spot next week and in the off season.
hryc8ga,2022-01-09 16:31:06,I hope you’re right
hryc82k,2022-01-09 16:31:03,theyd be dumb not to.
hryc7yb,2022-01-09 16:31:02,All praise the BOZGAWD
hryc7sy,2022-01-09 16:31:00,I'm no doctor but I think TJ got kneed in the balls
hryc7s7,2022-01-09 16:31:00,Ravens turned it over 3 times and we got a fg out of it
hryc7m6,2022-01-09 16:30:58,"hahaa, we so bad."
hryc7k5,2022-01-09 16:30:58,is this satire?
hryc77t,2022-01-09 16:30:55,"Shouldn’t Trent Jordan Watt have 2.5 sacks? Strip sack of Huntley early (did this go down as TFL?) .5 a sack with Heyward with the flag, then the clear sack afterwards?"
hryc6ss,2022-01-09 16:30:50,"Saw that, ouch but thank god haha"
hryc6d0,2022-01-09 16:30:46,I might not make it to 4 o clock. My heart can't take it.
hryc6bo,2022-01-09 16:30:46,To the balls????
hryc65k,2022-01-09 16:30:44,TJ noises intensify.
hryc63w,2022-01-09 16:30:44,bruh
hryc63f,2022-01-09 16:30:43,I dunno about 17. Haven’t really seen anything to show the ability to move the ball at all.
hryc5os,2022-01-09 16:30:39,Bosgod saves
hryc5ks,2022-01-09 16:30:38,[deleted]
hryc5fs,2022-01-09 16:30:37,Hopefully the guys see the Jacksonville score and get fired up
hryc5de,2022-01-09 16:30:37,The way this game is going Harvin is killing us
hryc5bt,2022-01-09 16:30:36,"If Najees out the rest of the game, I don’t see us scoring again. However, that’s not the worst thing. We’re not going anywhere in the playoffs and I’ll take TJ getting the sack record and better draft position."
hryc5a6,2022-01-09 16:30:36,Anyone else just catch the Steeler broadcast just now where Watt got hit in the twig and berries and they cut to a sign that says “SACK”?
hryc55a,2022-01-09 16:30:34,To the balls? That sounds terrible!
hryc4tt,2022-01-09 16:30:31,It brought me to my knees just watching it. 😐
hryc2bj,2022-01-09 16:30:06,"If you wanna get technical, TJ did."
hryc1zz,2022-01-09 16:30:03,Just because the ball gets knocked out doesn't mean it's not a sack.
hryc1ml,2022-01-09 16:29:59,So final s ore 9-6 steelers
hryc146,2022-01-09 16:29:54,Damn couldn't we Madden hail Mary or something...
hryc0i0,2022-01-09 16:29:48,Ok. Offense needs to learn how to score again.
hryc06x,2022-01-09 16:29:45,Someone get TJ the theragun STAT
hryc06q,2022-01-09 16:29:45,The offense should have 17. Matt Canada needs to be sacked at halftime
hrybztd,2022-01-09 16:29:41,Give Claypool the fucking ball
hrybz0n,2022-01-09 16:29:33,Nfl ruled it an aborted play so it didn't count
hrybypx,2022-01-09 16:29:30,Lady at the bar just said that she would rub that out when TJ was grimacing in pain on that pass deflection.. hahahahahahaahahahaha
hrybyld,2022-01-09 16:29:29,I offer my balls as tribute to TJ. I don’t get any bitches so I don’t need them
hrybyhh,2022-01-09 16:29:28,We're still in this. That stop was big. I'm pretty sure giving up 7 at this point would be insurmountable.
hrybvch,2022-01-09 16:28:57,Definitely lost a sack
hrybuy2,2022-01-09 16:28:54,Watt tied the sack record but had to sacrifice his sack
hrybum9,2022-01-09 16:28:51,He kneed him in the fucking balls.
hrybucp,2022-01-09 16:28:48,No he didn’t. Got kneed in the holy place.
hrybucd,2022-01-09 16:28:48,Nope
hrybua0,2022-01-09 16:28:47,Someone get TJ the theragun STAT
hrybu1x,2022-01-09 16:28:45,TJ will get DPOY but I 100% believe he deserves MVP
hrybttr,2022-01-09 16:28:43,Nfl players don’t wear cups I don’t think lol
hrybtt8,2022-01-09 16:28:43,Thank god
hrybtn4,2022-01-09 16:28:41,"This is why you wear a cup, no matter what."
hrybtmx,2022-01-09 16:28:41,Just a knee to the nuts. He’ll back out after he collects himself. Don’t think it’s that groin injury he’s struggled with
hrybtm1,2022-01-09 16:28:41,Doesn't look good. He might've sprained his wrist earlier.
hrybtav,2022-01-09 16:28:38,Keep your head up. Hard work and vitamins. You will get there!
hrybt3n,2022-01-09 16:28:37,Correct
hrybt1g,2022-01-09 16:28:36,Really? didn't see that on the replay
hrybszm,2022-01-09 16:28:36,fire. canada.
hrybsxq,2022-01-09 16:28:35,Hahahahahaha
hrybsrp,2022-01-09 16:28:34,He might have broke the other guys leg with his balls of steel
hrybsk1,2022-01-09 16:28:31,Not any better if it fucks up future Watts from getting it in 20 years later.
hrybsed,2022-01-09 16:28:30,He's hurt
hrybs9t,2022-01-09 16:28:29,Top comment lmao
hrybs7y,2022-01-09 16:28:28,It’s like how you put your knee up when your dog jumps but it’s actually the DPOY tj watt
hrybs7e,2022-01-09 16:28:28,Does that mean he loses a sack?
hrybs57,2022-01-09 16:28:28,[deleted]
hrybrvx,2022-01-09 16:28:25,He ain’t even playing right now.
hrybrvh,2022-01-09 16:28:25,That slow mo of the jump 👌
hrybrtl,2022-01-09 16:28:24,Got kneed in the balls
hryborw,2022-01-09 16:27:55,[deleted]
hryborl,2022-01-09 16:27:55,Watt is worth every penny. He's a game changer and picks up the slack for some many other players.
hryboq7,2022-01-09 16:27:55,Harbs go for I cowards! The analytics!
hrybomv,2022-01-09 16:27:54,No way TJ doesn’t come back to break the record
hrybomu,2022-01-09 16:27:54,hit in the balls
hryboet,2022-01-09 16:27:52,"TJ ties a record for sacks, and then gets his sack tied."
hryboe8,2022-01-09 16:27:51,Huntley nailed him in the nuts with his knee lmao
hryboba,2022-01-09 16:27:51,Right in the twigs and berries
hryboak,2022-01-09 16:27:50,The offense need to get their shit together in the 2nd half. With how the jags are playing this may not be ben’s last game
hryboa7,2022-01-09 16:27:50,He got kneed in the nuts
hrybo9x,2022-01-09 16:27:50,Not the groin
hrybo9n,2022-01-09 16:27:50,Any chance Najee breaks 98.5 receiving + rush yards?
hrybo9a,2022-01-09 16:27:50,Damn he nutted himself on Huntleys knee
hrybo7q,2022-01-09 16:27:50,Yes
hrybo5n,2022-01-09 16:27:49,"Of course the Jaguars are winning and the best the Steelers can do is 3 points. Story of the season, can never have a complete game."
hrybo4v,2022-01-09 16:27:49,Thought Watt hurt his hand turns out it was his giant ball sack
hrybo1u,2022-01-09 16:27:48,Only way to take tj down is go for the 🍆
hrybnxx,2022-01-09 16:27:47,That sucks. So he's actually at 24 by my count today if not for some fuckery.
hrybnxj,2022-01-09 16:27:47,"I'm not expecting a Najee quality dude lol, but Snell doesn't belong anywhere but a 3rd/4th string level guy, if he belongs on a 53 at all. Just give me a decent journeyman"
hrybnu5,2022-01-09 16:27:46,"3-3 at the half. It's like a vintage 2000s Steelers-Ravens game, now it just needs a vintage 2000s Steelers-Ravens finish and we're all good."
hrybnsc,2022-01-09 16:27:45,"Goddamn TJ is such a monster. They hold him every play and he still tied the NFL record. If they couldn't hold him, he'd have 30+ sacks this season"
hrybnqy,2022-01-09 16:27:45,Colts are getting outplayed.  But the Jags aren't putting up enough points :/
hrybno2,2022-01-09 16:27:44,took a knee to the manhood
hrybnca,2022-01-09 16:27:41,Happy for TJ. Dude deserves it. Sack record in Pittsburgh is fantastic
hrybnb8,2022-01-09 16:27:41,NOOO! NOT TJ'S COCK
hrybnap,2022-01-09 16:27:41,Knees in the nads
hrybn8r,2022-01-09 16:27:40,That would be hilarious.
hrybn75,2022-01-09 16:27:40,"No, nutsack was hit"
hrybn53,2022-01-09 16:27:39,Oof a knee to the nuts
hrybn27,2022-01-09 16:27:39,"Please tell me Watt just took a shot to the nuts and isn't hurt for the rest of the game.

Yeah Huntley kneed him in the nuts."
hrybmzg,2022-01-09 16:27:38,Oh... oh that hurt my marble sack...
hrybmtm,2022-01-09 16:27:36,TJ is a beast
hrybmsj,2022-01-09 16:27:36,Thats a knee to the baby makers
hrybmru,2022-01-09 16:27:36,He got knocked in the nuts
hrybmpn,2022-01-09 16:27:36,Noooooooo not the groin!
hrybmpm,2022-01-09 16:27:36,Just took a nut shot. He's gonna be fine
hrybmna,2022-01-09 16:27:35,Kneed in the nards
hrybmkw,2022-01-09 16:27:34,TJ just got a cup check
hrybmk9,2022-01-09 16:27:34,"Shit, that’s the groin.  He’s done.  Fuck."
hrybmim,2022-01-09 16:27:33,TJ I LOVE YOU
hrybmi7,2022-01-09 16:27:33,From your finger tips to gods ears
hrybmhl,2022-01-09 16:27:33,Holy wow that hurts
hrybmh7,2022-01-09 16:27:33,It’s not the groin. He got kicked in the balls.
hrybmbu,2022-01-09 16:27:32,TJs massive meat got caught up in the action he'll be fine
hrybm7f,2022-01-09 16:27:30,Damn I don’t know how to react
hryblzp,2022-01-09 16:27:28,Did Huntley knee him in the balls?
hryblxt,2022-01-09 16:27:28,It looked like Huntley kneed TJ in the nuts. Big fuckin oof.
hryblvn,2022-01-09 16:27:27,Lol bunch guys happy it’s only a hit to the balls Lolol
hryblry,2022-01-09 16:27:27,[deleted]
hryblru,2022-01-09 16:27:26,he definitely pulled that yikes
hryblro,2022-01-09 16:27:26,It was an aborted play and no longer a pass play. It’s dumb
hryblql,2022-01-09 16:27:26,"DPOY my ass

hryblp8,2022-01-09 16:27:26,He just took a knee pain to the peepee
hryblp1,2022-01-09 16:27:26,Watt - questionable (Nuts)
hryblol,2022-01-09 16:27:26,TJ literally dicked him down and it hurt the TJ-nuts.
hryblnn,2022-01-09 16:27:25,He tweaked that groin. That may be it for TJ
hryblmc,2022-01-09 16:27:25,Deez nuts
hrybllu,2022-01-09 16:27:25,Ouch town population you bro
hrybllf,2022-01-09 16:27:25,He got kicked in the nuts
hryblka,2022-01-09 16:27:24,Tackling Huntly hard is a penalty but a knee to TJ's nuts is okay.
hryblge,2022-01-09 16:27:23,Fucking Huntley kneeing TJ in the balls
hrybl5y,2022-01-09 16:27:21,One of these two teams is making the playoffs.

hrybhw6,2022-01-09 16:26:49,The rules it and aborted play. No sack.
hrybhvm,2022-01-09 16:26:49,Nut shot. Ouchie...
hrybhv2,2022-01-09 16:26:49,THAT should be a personal foul. Fuck

hrybgsy,2022-01-09 16:26:38,TJ WATT!!!!!!!
hrybgjb,2022-01-09 16:26:35,Someone said “aborted play”.  Funny that doesn’t count but Favre nosediving did.
hrybgg7,2022-01-09 16:26:35,"Yeah, I thought he and TJ should have gotten a half each there. They said it was a sack and then penalty."
hrybg64,2022-01-09 16:26:32,LETS GOOOO
hrybg5x,2022-01-09 16:26:32,We could win games w/Huntley

hrybfxa,2022-01-09 16:26:29,I’d ask if Matt Canada was coaching but there’s no denying he’s still coaching here
hrybfwp,2022-01-09 16:26:29,Lol yeah you'd think with the way people were talking in here that he broke the record.
hrybfqs,2022-01-09 16:26:27,Refs gonna be looking for every reason to give this to the ratbirds in the second half.
hrybflv,2022-01-09 16:26:26,Oh no his groin!
hrybfis,2022-01-09 16:26:25,I cannot believe how fucking bad Harvin is…
hrybfff,2022-01-09 16:26:24,TJ doesn't have a golfing buddy laying down for him
hrybfcq,2022-01-09 16:26:23,No TJ no
hrybfan,2022-01-09 16:26:23,Man he is a beast
hrybf8q,2022-01-09 16:26:22,"Nobody know, they called it an aborted play"
hrybf7o,2022-01-09 16:26:22,Shit TJ groin
hrybf2q,2022-01-09 16:26:20,"I don’t know but TJ has basically only played 14 games even if he’s started in 16
EDIT: I believe strahan played in 17 games"
hrybc6w,2022-01-09 16:25:52,Don’t know who it was but O-lineman there had TJ in a full on headlock…
hrybbyn,2022-01-09 16:25:50,Yes.
hrybbw7,2022-01-09 16:25:49,[deleted]
hrybbvo,2022-01-09 16:25:49,Should’ve been to take the record. Whatever he’ll just get it here
hrybbru,2022-01-09 16:25:48,"Wattttttt!!!!!!!!!!! He’s got it, now let’s go definitively get the record. Also why do I feel if he gets one more sack, that the earlier sack take n away will be credited. But if he didn’t they wouldn’t credit him idk. High off watt right now lol."
hrybbk5,2022-01-09 16:25:46,One more to go for the record. And Watt has done it all in 14 games.
hrybbgo,2022-01-09 16:25:45,Penalty erases it
hrybbfy,2022-01-09 16:25:44,Cash checks
hrybbd0,2022-01-09 16:25:43,Dpoy on LOCK
hrybb6h,2022-01-09 16:25:42,Jax has been at the goal line a couple times now and settled for field goals.
hrybb6a,2022-01-09 16:25:42,I love Cam but he knows you can't hit that high
hrybb1b,2022-01-09 16:25:40,16. TJ did it in 13.5.
hrybat9,2022-01-09 16:25:38,Wattage
hrybaq8,2022-01-09 16:25:37,So to and cam dont get the sack cause of roughness?
hrybalj,2022-01-09 16:25:36,"More like Bollywood Brown, amirite? 

(No offense to the Indian film industry intended.)"
hrybakg,2022-01-09 16:25:36,"So wait, he’s tied??"
hrybajw,2022-01-09 16:25:35,"Yeah, I don't get it..."
hrybajq,2022-01-09 16:25:35,Seems unlikely
hrybahf,2022-01-09 16:25:35,WATTTTTTTTT
hrybaaq,2022-01-09 16:25:33,TJ hasn't played in 16 games of that's what you're going for
hryba2h,2022-01-09 16:25:31,I think they go for it if we don't stop them here.

hryb90w,2022-01-09 16:25:20,Go Jags!
hryb8jh,2022-01-09 16:25:15,"So the problem with the ""hurr durr let me watch Ben one more time, if you disagree you're not a real fan"" crowd is, There is nothing to be gained by watching Ben and the Steelers lose a playoff game. Ben has been great and has had every opportunity to go out on his shield. However, he and this team, just doesn't have it anymore, at least not this season for sure. So, for me, it's either superbowl or bust, that doesn't mean I don't root for us to win that's just how I measure the success of this team. So, trot Ben out for one more primetime embarrassment? or better draft position and look forward to the unknown, exciting aspects of a new era in Steeler football. It's time for whatever's next, and with that, a few spots in the middle of the draft make a HUGE difference as far as the type of player you can get. When you even suggest the idea of such a thing, it gets met with mind-numbing levels of homer-isms and gatekeeping. There is no reasonable argument to be made that isn't basely purely on selfishness."
hryb8hi,2022-01-09 16:25:15,DPOY!!

hryb586,2022-01-09 16:24:44,Watt should be 1.5 sacks above the prior record right now.
hryb55l,2022-01-09 16:24:43,Bullshit. I hate all these rules that make it easy on the QB and impossible on the defense
hryb4ug,2022-01-09 16:24:41,TJ!!!!

hryb4n5,2022-01-09 16:24:38,"Shouldn't he get a half sack on the Heyward sack?

Or does the penalty negate the sack?"
hryb4n1,2022-01-09 16:24:38,That's what you fucking get Huntley. Hope it keeps happening for the rest of your day.
hryb4mb,2022-01-09 16:24:38,Glad we paid watt
hryb4kw,2022-01-09 16:24:38,"helmet on helmet, they're gonna call that every time."
hryb4ha,2022-01-09 16:24:37,I think TJ just got the record. I believe the NFL will change the first one after the game.

hryb3lt,2022-01-09 16:24:28,Did watt give a half sack on the previous play with Heyward?
hryb3dr,2022-01-09 16:24:26,Fuck these announcers and if a QB wants to play the game like a running back they should be able to get hit like one.

We’ve played essentially everyone who may face in the wild card and have looked like complete shit. I think we win if Canada stops calling plays, Najee is 100%, and Big Ben figures out how to complete a ball 5 yards down field."
hryb2ua,2022-01-09 16:24:21,Sorry that's not a sack. That's a run play for loss. Huntley was clearly the runner.

hryaqs7,2022-01-09 16:22:25,"How was there no hold against Watt?  A ref should have eyes on him all game, we KNOW he's gonna get held"
hryaqkv,2022-01-09 16:22:23,TJ!
hryaqe8,2022-01-09 16:22:21,Hold on Watt not called again
hryaqak,2022-01-09 16:22:20,How about that hold on Watt?
hryaq7e,2022-01-09 16:22:20,We are not playing well but at worst it’s 8-3 going into the half.
hryaq47,2022-01-09 16:22:19,"The offense is vomit inducing, but it's pretty funny that the only reason the Ravens are threatening to score is because for some reason Tomlin and co. decided to allow Harvin to punt this game despite everyone with eyes thinking he lost the job."
hryaq2w,2022-01-09 16:22:18,"Um no our incompetent offense will, of the offense continues the game won't even be close because they won't won't sniff field goal range again"

hryak2o,2022-01-09 16:21:20,"Dude, put the weed down."
hryak0b,2022-01-09 16:21:19,Leave it to the Steelers to lose when the teams controlling their destiny actually give them the results they need.

hryajpl,2022-01-09 16:21:16,Yikes I don’t want to see this offense try to play from behind. But whatever fuck it…
hryajp2,2022-01-09 16:21:16,If dumb yinzers had their way we would have thrown Boswell aside too... I'm willing to wait until next season.
hryajoe,2022-01-09 16:21:16,Tomlin should be fired for putting that fat cunt Harvin back in.
hryajkd,2022-01-09 16:21:15,I honestly don't even know if I want them to get in... watching them all season you know they're going to get pummeled in the wild card.
hryaja1,2022-01-09 16:21:12,"I think there’s a strong argument to be made there. Genuinely, his piss-poor punting has lost us so much field position… could see us winning one, MAYBE two more games were it not for a handful of particularly poor punts."
hryaj97,2022-01-09 16:21:11,This organization has been making some seriously questionable decisions lately
hryaiwg,2022-01-09 16:21:08,Holy fuck… I’m keeping last weeks memory a nice one and turning this game off.
hryaifs,2022-01-09 16:21:03,Harvin costing us the lead jjst like the Titans game
hryai8p,2022-01-09 16:21:02,"Can’t even blame the defense, they’re clearly gassed. If this offense could do anything and if Harvin could punt it more than 2 yards then maybe the D gets a real chance"
hryai1u,2022-01-09 16:21:00,Why are they letting him run?
hryahum,2022-01-09 16:20:58,"Jags first down at the 2


8 seconds left"
hryahf7,2022-01-09 16:20:53,If the Ravens win and the Jags win then I will officially give up football until next season. Disgusting.
hryaf4z,2022-01-09 16:20:31,Matt Canada: Pathetically predictable and predictably pathetic
hryaf4a,2022-01-09 16:20:30,Tomlin is calling timeouts like we're not just going to call a draw or short screen pass
hryaf13,2022-01-09 16:20:30,We would play KC
hryaewd,2022-01-09 16:20:28,We’ve literally seen ben punt farther before
hryaeq2,2022-01-09 16:20:26,Yeah called it before the game. Jacksonville will actually pull out a win and we'll figure out how to lose.
hryae7b,2022-01-09 16:20:21,Pull Harvin
hryae4d,2022-01-09 16:20:20,Not letting waitman punt was a big mistake
hryady4,2022-01-09 16:20:19,Well this is the turning point.

hryado0,2022-01-09 16:20:16,We need a pick 6
hryadnl,2022-01-09 16:20:15,Lol no clue why Harvin got a helmet over Waitman today
hryadku,2022-01-09 16:20:15,Just let Ben air it out on 4th down for an interception. He’d get more yards.
hryaddb,2022-01-09 16:20:13,I feel like the entire coaching staff is fucking with us
hryad0e,2022-01-09 16:20:09,somebody has to die
hryacv5,2022-01-09 16:20:08,Need a turnover!!!
hryact6,2022-01-09 16:20:07,Bodymore gets the ball back in second half too.
hryaco6,2022-01-09 16:20:06,Prob cause his Dad died and they got sentimental instead of making the business decision
hryacj6,2022-01-09 16:20:05,Pity isn't a valid reason to roster a professional football player.
hryacdv,2022-01-09 16:20:03,Huntley throwing like Favre out there while Ben lobbing ints
hryac9l,2022-01-09 16:20:02,Why are we still starting Harvin?
hryac59,2022-01-09 16:20:01,Fucking baffling. With the playoffs on the line.
hryac0y,2022-01-09 16:19:59,Thanks Harvin now Ravens will score
hryabwm,2022-01-09 16:19:58,HOLDING ON WORMLEY ARE THE REFS BLIND
hryabw3,2022-01-09 16:19:58,"Steelers in the playoffs would be tough to watch. If we give Cincy their first playoff win in 30 hears, I'll be majorly bummed."
hryabv7,2022-01-09 16:19:58,Yes.
hryabub,2022-01-09 16:19:58,Why is Mark Andrews open on every play?

hryabl4,2022-01-09 16:19:55,Nice push off Andrews
hryabk8,2022-01-09 16:19:55,Tomlin with another game losing decision by playing Harvin
hryabjf,2022-01-09 16:19:55,"Ahhhhh wanted harvin to be good, and hopefully he pans out. But the other punter is way better!!!"
hryabd2,2022-01-09 16:19:53,I feel we’ve lost games this year because of Harvin.
hryabcy,2022-01-09 16:19:53,Need a new punter next year Harvin ain't it
hryabbt,2022-01-09 16:19:52,What happened to the punter we had last week… we need him
hrya8tf,2022-01-09 16:19:28,Please cut Harvin.
hrya8nf,2022-01-09 16:19:27,"my gripe with this coaching staff again, the decision making. you have a punter who played well for 2 weeks. and a punter that lost his father and has not played well. somehow you play the bad punter in the last game of the year. so, why are we not rewarding good play? im flabbergasted"
hrya8lt,2022-01-09 16:19:26,This hurts to watch.
hrya8e9,2022-01-09 16:19:24,Our play calling better improve in the second half. We need to at least get a first down
hrya8bv,2022-01-09 16:19:23,Wow... Okay well. Harvin needs to compete for the spot this off-season for sure
hrya8bd,2022-01-09 16:19:23,Fuck Harvin

hrya7g7,2022-01-09 16:19:14,"Smfh I called it, unfortunately lmao. This team is so predictable. 3 and out, Harvin shanked punt, ravens score before the half …. Unbelievable"
hrya7e8,2022-01-09 16:19:14,Everyone looks horrible today. Can't say anyone is having a good game.
hrya7ap,2022-01-09 16:19:13,Harvin is not good enough unfortunately
hrya771,2022-01-09 16:19:11,He’s too fat he can’t pick his leg up
hrya76c,2022-01-09 16:19:11,You can’t suck punting from your own end. Goddamnit.
hrya70l,2022-01-09 16:19:10,"Happy Birthday,  Princess Tommy!"
hrya6zh,2022-01-09 16:19:09,Harvin needs to join Buggs.

hrya622,2022-01-09 16:19:00,There was no reason to bench Waitman today
hrya5v2,2022-01-09 16:18:58,How the fuck is Harvin still our punter how fucking stupid are our coaches

hrya5ib,2022-01-09 16:18:55,Holy fucking shit we are bad. Next season is gonna be brutal if we're currently playing our best option at QB
hrya5hi,2022-01-09 16:18:55,"Lmao Heyward throwing his hands up. This game is 100% a loss if Ben continues this, no way they have the balls to put Rudolph in to give us a chance"

hrya5a8,2022-01-09 16:18:53,Eight seconds of offense that was
hrya595,2022-01-09 16:18:53,Their punter is booting it & pinning us deep while Harvin hasn't had one good punt so far.

hrya0s1,2022-01-09 16:18:09,With each punt I want the replacement punter back.

hrya0n7,2022-01-09 16:18:08,bro wtf is this play calling
hrya0m5,2022-01-09 16:18:08,"I assume you’ve watched a lot of Steeler games versus you guys over the years…by now you should know if we are playing away we are playing ultra conservative unless forced out of that by the score.  If you guys can’t put up points offensively the Steelers will be content to run for 1 yard gains and punt the ball and hope to win by a FG or late drive.  That’s what we do.

It’s not fun to watch as a fan but they’ve been pretty successful with that model - and I think you guys are probably pretty similar too which is why the score is 3-0."
hrya0bb,2022-01-09 16:18:04,Ben looks fucking horrible

hry9s3s,2022-01-09 16:16:44,"Canada saving his worst game for the last, I see. A high school coach could literally understand that you don't attack a team's ONE strength when it's additionally one of your BIGGEST weaknesses."
hry9rva,2022-01-09 16:16:41,"You just know Harbaugh wants to wreck TJ's chances whereas Favre gave up the record sack. Really, TJ already tied it if you take away the sack Favre gave up on purpose.  Doesn't work like that though..obviously."

hry94ee,2022-01-09 16:12:51,"I am hoping the Jags colts game is close, just in case I have to start to root for Indy to keep the Ravens out of the playoffs."
hry94d6,2022-01-09 16:12:51,Both teams are so bad man
hry94a0,2022-01-09 16:12:50,Andrews wondering why there wasn’t a flag on that one too.
hry93qo,2022-01-09 16:12:45,Bunch of PUSSIES. Double team two tackles on TJ
hry93ld,2022-01-09 16:12:43,IT FITS HE IS BENJAMIN BUTTON!!!
hry93dn,2022-01-09 16:12:41,TJ getting double teamed literally every play. He will still get the sack record tho
hry92wc,2022-01-09 16:12:36,Thank god
hry92n6,2022-01-09 16:12:34,Canada is terrible. Ben is struggling. Najee on the bench. Johnson got banged up. Juju dancing on the bench as always. LET'S GO DEFENSE!
hry912x,2022-01-09 16:12:18,TJ running out of time
hry90yg,2022-01-09 16:12:17,Is Haskins active?   Really wanted to see him play this season.   Christ he was a 1st rounder 3 years ago.   Any news about him getting any better??
hry90x2,2022-01-09 16:12:17,They would’ve called it a run if he was
hry90vq,2022-01-09 16:12:16,What a shit field. Everyone's on ice out there.
hry8xdm,2022-01-09 16:11:42,"Ahha, that is stupid. I can see if the QB just falls on the ball and you touch him down, but if they stand back up and have the time/opportunity to throw the ball, it should be a sack."
hry8xa7,2022-01-09 16:11:41,Huntley sooo happy he didn't fumble there lmao
hry8x2r,2022-01-09 16:11:39,Whenever Huntley gives up an easy sack TJ isn't in.
hry8wy7,2022-01-09 16:11:38,Why not let TJ have it?
hry8wx5,2022-01-09 16:11:37,"Positive affirmation

Everything is calm"
hry8vyl,2022-01-09 16:11:28,"Damn, why couldn't TJ be on the field for that"
hry8vg2,2022-01-09 16:11:23,You're loving this first half? This game is a loss if it continues  like this on offense.
hry8vfz,2022-01-09 16:11:23,"Fuck you, homer"
hry8vb0,2022-01-09 16:11:22,I 100% blame the coaching staff for not being able to get this team going until the 4th quarter. How do you manage to look like this EVERY game and make no adjustments?
hry8utx,2022-01-09 16:11:17,"What are the FA corners next year because 

1.	We need to draft oline man
2.	we suck at drafting corners"
hry8udn,2022-01-09 16:11:13,Fully prepared for this outcome
hry8u6d,2022-01-09 16:11:11,Strahan sack opportunity there
hry8u48,2022-01-09 16:11:10,Both teams are out
hry8u3g,2022-01-09 16:11:10,Andrew’s is literally he only playmaker they have left come on
hry8tqm,2022-01-09 16:11:07,I really dislike Andrews.
hry8tov,2022-01-09 16:11:06,If we win this and Jax wins we HAVE to get Najee back. Our offense is nothing without him
hry8qnj,2022-01-09 16:10:37,Prediction: JAX beats the Colts and we don’t take care of business today.
hry8qd0,2022-01-09 16:10:34,I’m just telling myself we’ll come alive In the second half
hry8pxz,2022-01-09 16:10:30,"Would love to see Tomlin pull Ben and see what Mason can do. Nothing to lose really, and if you make the playoffs it's like playing with house money."
hry8pvy,2022-01-09 16:10:29,I'd prefer we do runs which don't rely on a poor offensive line to open holes for a subpar runner and then continuing to do those same plays with little to no results ending in another kick on 4th and long.
hry8pmq,2022-01-09 16:10:27,I think ben has already mentally retired
hry8pgt,2022-01-09 16:10:25,Idk what wrong with everyone on here. Bens just trying to give TJ more opportunities to get this record.
hry8p7i,2022-01-09 16:10:23,Jesus fucking christ
hry8owz,2022-01-09 16:10:20,Can we just throw slants please
hry8omm,2022-01-09 16:10:17,Ben is having a terrible final game
hry8old,2022-01-09 16:10:17,WHY THE FUCK IS MAULET PLAYING????
hry8oi0,2022-01-09 16:10:16,man we can’t guard mark andrews
hry8ohi,2022-01-09 16:10:16,This is painful…but it wouldn’t shock me if a different guy showed up in the second half.
hry8oca,2022-01-09 16:10:14,I liked Maulet better on the sideline
hry8o9s,2022-01-09 16:10:14,Did the Steelers forget that they’re playing for a chance in the playoffs?
hry8o7w,2022-01-09 16:10:13,Brain damage making him see ghosts
hry8o7j,2022-01-09 16:10:13,Trademark Steelers first half. Loving it
hry8o1z,2022-01-09 16:10:12,You gotta run sometimes
hry8nuf,2022-01-09 16:10:10,Andrew’s is the whole Ravens offense
hry8ngz,2022-01-09 16:10:06,50 yard kick after he got a lucky bounce. Whoever sat Waitman should be fired. Its such a simple decision that is handled so fucking horribly
hry8ngu,2022-01-09 16:10:06,Two*
hry8ngt,2022-01-09 16:10:06,Snell football was a gimmick to get this dude drafted I swear.
hry8kcg,2022-01-09 16:09:36,You spelled McCloud wrong
hry8k8k,2022-01-09 16:09:35,Can Benny snell not see? I’ve never seen a rb miss so many blatantly obvious holes my god
hry8k4r,2022-01-09 16:09:34,This bad punting is gonna bite us in the ass in a field position dominated game
hry8k1r,2022-01-09 16:09:34,It’s heavily Snell
hry8jvz,2022-01-09 16:09:32,Our offense looks like straight dick
hry8jqg,2022-01-09 16:09:31,Dude is seeing ghosts or something
hry8jd2,2022-01-09 16:09:27,I mean... it's your choice.  I'm just saying Huch Jr. has YEARS of screwing the Steelers to catch up with daddy... but you do you :)
hry8jcc,2022-01-09 16:09:27,Well a deep shot on 3rd and 8 is better than a deep shot on 3rd and 2 I guess...
hry8jb6,2022-01-09 16:09:26,I can’t be the only one wondering who  that pass was for.
hry8j8q,2022-01-09 16:09:26,Finally a good punt
hry8j5j,2022-01-09 16:09:25,Probably a receiver who ran the wrong route
hry8iqo,2022-01-09 16:09:21,"Ben looked at the Jags score, and was like nah I'm ready to retire"
hry8ijr,2022-01-09 16:09:19,Nice of our offense to keep stalling too give tj a chance at the record
hry8ibc,2022-01-09 16:09:17,"Yeah duh, Canada did that"
hry8i80,2022-01-09 16:09:16,Why is harvin punting? Waitman was better than harvin has been at any point in the season
hry8i5o,2022-01-09 16:09:15,"My second “Big Ben gotta go” post, but yeah…you gotta go, big guy. Thanks for the memories."
hry8hv9,2022-01-09 16:09:13,I don't wanna see snell ever again
hry8huc,2022-01-09 16:09:12,So we're legit playing not to win
hry8hma,2022-01-09 16:09:10,Who was that too?
hry8hlg,2022-01-09 16:09:10,Lol. The jags are gonna win and we’re gonna lose and the ravens are gonna end up in the playoffs
hry8hi5,2022-01-09 16:09:09,Can we win 3-0? I hope so.

hry8hhk,2022-01-09 16:09:09,[could be worse I guess](https://twitter.com/MySportsUpdate/status/1480254911937974278?s=20)
hry8hbx,2022-01-09 16:09:07,My man threw that almost right into that defenders hands
hry8h97,2022-01-09 16:09:07,Okay nice last home game for Ben last week but I’m ready to see him leave. Lol
hry8h4h,2022-01-09 16:09:05,"Watt may need a sack strip, scoop, and score at this rate."
hry8gzs,2022-01-09 16:09:04,I mean...would you prefer we never run?
hry8gyu,2022-01-09 16:09:04,We needed that punt.
hry8gy9,2022-01-09 16:09:04,Jesus christ man
hry8gxv,2022-01-09 16:09:04,Ok Ben. 1 is enough..
hry8do0,2022-01-09 16:08:33,Indy 4th & 12
hry8dnx,2022-01-09 16:08:33,Absolutely awful offense. Can’t stand this shit. It’s just 3 and outs over and over again.
hry8dlf,2022-01-09 16:08:32,[deleted]
hry8ctw,2022-01-09 16:08:25,Snell EXPLODING for two.
hry8ctc,2022-01-09 16:08:25,Boy our offense ain’t very good
hry8cpp,2022-01-09 16:08:23,That’s the wrong team
hry8cnu,2022-01-09 16:08:23,What’s the definition of instanity?
hry8cm0,2022-01-09 16:08:22,JAGS FORCE 4th
hry8chn,2022-01-09 16:08:21,Has been all season
hry8c8z,2022-01-09 16:08:19,I don't even know who that pass was intended for
hry8c6e,2022-01-09 16:08:18,"2nd and 10... running play for Snell right up the middle.

Why?"
hry8c6d,2022-01-09 16:08:18,Who's ben thrown to ghosts
hry8c40,2022-01-09 16:08:18,Lol this an old school game
hry8c3u,2022-01-09 16:08:18,Cmon Ben who you throwing to?
hry8c28,2022-01-09 16:08:17,These running plays are terrible and it’s not snell
hry8bt4,2022-01-09 16:08:15,Ben is literally throwing to nobody this game
hry8br4,2022-01-09 16:08:14,What are these fucking plays
hry8bkw,2022-01-09 16:08:12,I had the same thought earlier 😂
hry8bey,2022-01-09 16:08:11,"I wouldn't blame Harbaughs game plan. If it works and they score and win, nicely done. If it doesn't he'll have to change up, or lose stupidly, and he won't do that. Up to the offense to get points and force Huntley to face Watt"
hry8av3,2022-01-09 16:08:05,"2 yard throw, run. If Canada is the OC next year we could have Aaron Rodgers at QB and we’d be lucky to go 8-8-1"
hry8atp,2022-01-09 16:08:05,"Chase needs targets. It’s as simple as that, hope the next oc gets him more involved as he should."
hry8ag5,2022-01-09 16:08:01,Thanks for info. Hope it means it’s not a serious injury if he’s probable
hry8a70,2022-01-09 16:07:59,You give too much credit to our offense
hry8a6n,2022-01-09 16:07:59,This offense lol
hry8a2z,2022-01-09 16:07:58,We might have to win this game 3-0 or hope for defensive points.
hry8a08,2022-01-09 16:07:57,Ben’s process is just so slow. Gentry was wide open for a 5 yard gain on first down.
hry89zm,2022-01-09 16:07:57,"We're honestly,  objectively terrible."
hry89yj,2022-01-09 16:07:57,How badly does Matt Canada hate 2nd down passing plays
hry89wk,2022-01-09 16:07:56,Ben looks so indecisive today... not good
hry873t,2022-01-09 16:07:30,FUCK MATT CANADA. JESUS WTF IS HE DOING.
hry85rv,2022-01-09 16:07:17,Claypool was wide open
hry85ls,2022-01-09 16:07:16,Wish the Steelers would utilize play action in even a minor capacity.
hry8559,2022-01-09 16:07:12,Q2: 2:00 - Jaguars 10 - Colts 3
hry84qy,2022-01-09 16:07:08,Plays like that is what happens when you have Ben sit there and hold the ball to throw intermediate routes all game
hry80h0,2022-01-09 16:06:28,i was wondering what the problem was
hry809d,2022-01-09 16:06:26,"""FUCK THROWING, WE WILL RUN THE BALL DOWN THEIR GODDAMN THROATS UNTIL THEY LOVE US."" - Matt Canada, probably."
hry807y,2022-01-09 16:06:25,"Stadium gets SO LOUD when Watt gets close. Steelers fans wanting him to get the record, Ravens fans wanting him not to."
hry7zxn,2022-01-09 16:06:23,a terrible ruling that even though its a pass play and the quarterback is tackled in the backfield somehow a bad snap negates that
hry7zqj,2022-01-09 16:06:21,I bet Canada has some shit plays designed
hry7z53,2022-01-09 16:06:15,Micah parsons deserves it more than donald
hry7z33,2022-01-09 16:06:15,"Absolutely, the offense is so unbelievably bad"
hry7z2w,2022-01-09 16:06:15,Alright let’s get them off balance boys. Start off with the ray ray screen on first down follow it up with runs up the middle on 2nd and 3rd down
hry7yuw,2022-01-09 16:06:13,Aaron Donald is not going to win it
hry7ydh,2022-01-09 16:06:08,Same here changed my t shirt and got into my jersey
hry7y4g,2022-01-09 16:06:06,Skinny one
hry7xju,2022-01-09 16:06:01,"2 runs up the middle for 1 yard each, then hail Mary into double coverage with Baltimore interception"
hry7xgj,2022-01-09 16:06:00,Same. If favre lying down counts then so does this one.
hry7xdl,2022-01-09 16:05:59,"So does Ben and Snell, obviously.  Trying to max his chances."
hry7x9u,2022-01-09 16:05:58,Lol I'm more worried about this game
hry7tx7,2022-01-09 16:05:26,which punter is more impressive right now
hry7ttd,2022-01-09 16:05:25,Take the earpiece out Ben let’s go win this
hry7tgi,2022-01-09 16:05:22,These 2 games are going to go down to the wire...WATCH lol
hry7tdg,2022-01-09 16:05:21,Still not sure how the first one wasn’t a sack
hry7t2y,2022-01-09 16:05:19,Haha if the Steelers make it they might be the worst playoff team of all time
hry7swy,2022-01-09 16:05:17,[deleted]
hry7sjr,2022-01-09 16:05:14,"Wouldn’t mind, but I feel like we’re stuck with Mason"

hry7s8b,2022-01-09 16:05:10,"Honestly, same. Is that wrong? lol"
hry7s7f,2022-01-09 16:05:10,Seconded.  I'd rather he obliterate the record over getting in the playoffs.
hry7rpv,2022-01-09 16:05:05,Packers fan here watching for the record
hry7rni,2022-01-09 16:05:05,Fuck the Ravens and the NFL scorers. The record should be tied and the way Harbaugh is designing shit I doubt that TJ gets the record. He is getting doubled and tripled every rush and they’re throwing quick passes. Bullshit way just for the AP to justify giving the DPOY to Aaron Donald…
hry7rmw,2022-01-09 16:05:05,Wow unbelievable
hry7rku,2022-01-09 16:05:04,When they listed the players that aren’t playing today his name was on the list because of Covid
hry7rhq,2022-01-09 16:05:03,Who gets the ball first in second half of jags game?
hry7rh7,2022-01-09 16:05:03,"༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ TJ Watt take my energy ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ

Almost immediately after I put it on, he nearly gets the sack. Clearly I’ve done it right 😂"

hry7r14,2022-01-09 16:04:59,More runs up the middle??
hry7qkb,2022-01-09 16:04:55,"This a joke. He literally had the record, but he was literally stolen a sack and now Huntley COME ON.."
hry7qg8,2022-01-09 16:04:54,Ditto.
hry7qb1,2022-01-09 16:04:52,Cmon ben. Tell Canada to fuck off
hry7ncf,2022-01-09 16:04:24,"TJ had the big donger in hand, doing a lasso-dick motion, and Huntley just barely got that ball off."
hry7miw,2022-01-09 16:04:16,"I’m gonna keep saying it, POSITIVE AFFIRMATION

LETS GO"
hry7mgz,2022-01-09 16:04:16,"I don’t care about playoffs, just want Watt to have this record"
hry7meo,2022-01-09 16:04:15,Josh Allen is good at football
hry7mbs,2022-01-09 16:04:15,My stream is at least 20 seconds behind lol
hry7kyj,2022-01-09 16:04:02,"I don't think ever been blue balled so hard. Come on TJ, don't leave me hanging"
hry7kpp,2022-01-09 16:04:00,That was close enough that they should just give it to Watt.
hry7kgl,2022-01-09 16:03:57,DAMN IT SO CLOSE
hry7kb7,2022-01-09 16:03:56,GOOD SHIT BOYS. Love the bump on Andrews from Maulet
hry7jox,2022-01-09 16:03:50,Yes
hry7jj0,2022-01-09 16:03:49,Same. I would love to get Ben to the playoffs but we would get steamrolled by the chiefs again
hry7fch,2022-01-09 16:03:10,I want TJ to get the record more than I want the Steelers to make the playoffs bros
hry7fb8,2022-01-09 16:03:09,So goddam close.
hry7fak,2022-01-09 16:03:09,See they had a guy there chipping him
hry7f12,2022-01-09 16:03:07,How many is TJ at? 1 more to tie?
hry7elg,2022-01-09 16:03:02,Good tackle joe

hry7d1z,2022-01-09 16:02:47,Lol so TJ got the forced fumble but not the sack? How does that work???
hry7cyl,2022-01-09 16:02:46,Fuck almost TJ
hry7cyg,2022-01-09 16:02:46,"Damn Haden, helluva hit."

hry7cd3,2022-01-09 16:02:40,Is Canada calling plays for both teams?
hry7c9k,2022-01-09 16:02:39,Thank you for fixing that!
hry77pw,2022-01-09 16:01:54,TJ strip sack coming up
hry77pf,2022-01-09 16:01:54,They got a much harder path
hry76nf,2022-01-09 16:01:44,Just another Steel and Teal Sunday
hry7606,2022-01-09 16:01:38,"Would be the ultimate ball smack if the ravens win, jaguars win, and the ravens make the playoffs lmao"
hry75wi,2022-01-09 16:01:36,"Figured out what was wrong… I was only wearing a Steelers shirt and not my #90 jersey.

Jersey’s on now, game’s gonna look different now. You’re welcome, everyone! 👍🏽"
hry75wh,2022-01-09 16:01:36,Horrible spot
hry75w1,2022-01-09 16:01:36,Didn't he slide well short of the sticks
hry75f1,2022-01-09 16:01:32,Huntley has some beautiful passes. More game time and he can be dangerous.
hry759f,2022-01-09 16:01:30,"Come on, give us TJ at least"
hry72b7,2022-01-09 16:01:01,Our offense is depressing

hry71ox,2022-01-09 16:00:55,Regarding Harvin. The guy has had a rough  60 days. Where is the humanity around here?
hry71bd,2022-01-09 16:00:52,Probable to return
hry716f,2022-01-09 16:00:50,I think Jags should have went for it
hry70vi,2022-01-09 16:00:48,A pro punter should be able to pin an opponent inside the ten with no return from that spot on the field.
hry70sl,2022-01-09 16:00:47,10-3 Jag offs
hry70g5,2022-01-09 16:00:43,Jags doing their part.
hry6zz7,2022-01-09 16:00:39,I mean fuck it. I would do it regardless
hry6zuz,2022-01-09 16:00:38,Next half.
hry6z85,2022-01-09 16:00:31,I am not exaggerating. I don’t give a shit about the playoffs. I just want TJ to break that gap-toothed fucker’s record. Please just let him get a sack so I can relax.
hry6z3d,2022-01-09 16:00:30,"Jacksonville field goal. They lead 10-3, but you really wanted a td there."
hry6z0i,2022-01-09 16:00:29,Offence has been giving so many good field positions and we have 3 points to show for it
hry6ysb,2022-01-09 16:00:27,Dri was a 3rd round. This dude was the 3rd last pick of the draft. Hardly comparable. Although Harvin is genuinely hurting the team significantly every game
hry6ys7,2022-01-09 16:00:27,You spelled Artie burns name wrong
hry6ys3,2022-01-09 16:00:27,He should definitely be competing for the spot next season
hry6w6t,2022-01-09 16:00:01,Ben has been throwing hospital passes all season.
hry6vjg,2022-01-09 15:59:55,Ben looks awful this game. Like he's shitting out floaters
hry6uw7,2022-01-09 15:59:49,Bruh give me Waitman next season please
hry6urr,2022-01-09 15:59:48,"I know Harvin is dealing with a lot off the field, so I won't judge this season too harshly. With that being said, he's gotta be a lot better next season if he wants to keep his job"
hry6ur5,2022-01-09 15:59:48,Punt boy
hry6uo6,2022-01-09 15:59:47,🎶 BLAME CANADA 🎶
hry6ul4,2022-01-09 15:59:46,At least this one got inside the 20… barely
hry6uic,2022-01-09 15:59:45,Can we please get tj a sack or 8 now?
hry6u4v,2022-01-09 15:59:42,Lol they're saying the rain made DJ slip we all know he slips when it's 72 and sunny
hry6u0c,2022-01-09 15:59:40,He’s probable to return
hry6ttu,2022-01-09 15:59:39,Really disappointing game from Harvin so far
hry6tlp,2022-01-09 15:59:37,Welp lets run the ball again because that works
hry6tl9,2022-01-09 15:59:37,Or that if you just get three yards you might be going for it on 4th
hry6thz,2022-01-09 15:59:36,He’s out…Covid
hry6tf6,2022-01-09 15:59:35,Harvin has had 3 chances to easily pin them in their 15 and has failed all three times.
hry6t83,2022-01-09 15:59:33,Well at least the Jags/Colts game is looking pretty good.
hry6t57,2022-01-09 15:59:32,He slipped? That had nothing to do with toughness.
hry6t53,2022-01-09 15:59:32,"Official report is ""probable."" If this were the Super Bowl he probably comes back in. But they've had to fit him with a brace and practice not fumbling. And it's raining. Unless its the 4th and Jacksonville looks like it's secured a win and we are ahead and need to ice the game, I don't know if he comes in."
hry6t1v,2022-01-09 15:59:31,This is some of the worst offense I've ever seen.
hry6szk,2022-01-09 15:59:31,Don't look now but here come the Jags
hry6srx,2022-01-09 15:59:28,26 yard punt Jesus christ I could punt that far
hry6shn,2022-01-09 15:59:25,[deleted]
hry6pxm,2022-01-09 15:59:00,This team is trash. The jags will win the Steelers will lose
hry6prr,2022-01-09 15:58:58,"My God, these punts. My kid could hit it farther."
hry6pld,2022-01-09 15:58:56,"Not saying he deserved it, but I'm not surprised queen got hurt, he's been running around recklessly in this first half"
hry6pkx,2022-01-09 15:58:56,"Do you think if we offered all of our worst players who we hate, the Jags would trade us Trevor Lawrence?"
hry6pbc,2022-01-09 15:58:54,If the jaguars win and we can’t get it done that would be sad. May take me weeks to recover from that
hry6p6t,2022-01-09 15:58:53,Fichtner for sure
hry6ou6,2022-01-09 15:58:49,Jax about to score
hry6o5d,2022-01-09 15:58:43,That was a 26 yard punt....
hry6nuw,2022-01-09 15:58:40,He has covid
hry6nob,2022-01-09 15:58:38,"Elbow injury, probable to return"
hry6n1g,2022-01-09 15:58:32,We have the softest WR in the league with out juju
hry6n15,2022-01-09 15:58:32,This offense makes me want to stay my eyeballs out
hry6mpn,2022-01-09 15:58:29,He's gonna be a cheap TE2 and he's decent. I love it
hry6j23,2022-01-09 15:57:54,Serious question: Matt canada or randy sphincter ?
hry6iz4,2022-01-09 15:57:53,"Sure, I see your point."
hry6its,2022-01-09 15:57:51,Thanks all.
hry6icm,2022-01-09 15:57:47,Jags driving
hry6i5u,2022-01-09 15:57:45,Stop fucking running on first down
hry6hwe,2022-01-09 15:57:42,Trevor Lawrence is actually going off.
hry6hui,2022-01-09 15:57:42,I heard someone say he’s going to play but haven’t seen him.
hry6hra,2022-01-09 15:57:41,After the stunt harbaugh pulled in Denver there’s no chance he’s letting TJ have a shot at the record
hry6hlg,2022-01-09 15:57:40,Wait...you mean they aren't both MUUUUUTH?
hry6hdu,2022-01-09 15:57:38,Resign Gentry this off-season before he gets expensive. They'll have the money
hry6hcw,2022-01-09 15:57:37,Send Canada to a Siberian gulag I sentence him to 15 years hard labor
hry6hbh,2022-01-09 15:57:37,I love having Ray Ray run all over the place behind the line. Helps absolutely nothing.
hry6h7f,2022-01-09 15:57:36,"RUN, THROW BEHIND THE LINE OH MY GOD FUCJING STOP"
hry6h5r,2022-01-09 15:57:35,"Canada is really out here running bootlegs and plays requiring Ben to move laterally as our primary passing plays against the worst secondary in the league... Seriously, fuck this guy"
hry6h57,2022-01-09 15:57:35,STOP RUNNING!
hry6h50,2022-01-09 15:57:35,"You're wrong.  Ed clearly had once had his luggage lost at the Pittsburgh Airport,  or had his cat run away in the city, or solemn.  He HATED the Steelers."
hry6gv6,2022-01-09 15:57:33,Fr know what’s coming everytime from my damn couch
hry6gv3,2022-01-09 15:57:33,And the lions are beating the Packers…what is happening today
hry6gr5,2022-01-09 15:57:31,3rd and 7... Screen play behind the line to ray ray coming up
hry6ge8,2022-01-09 15:57:28,JAGS BIG PLAY
hry6g1f,2022-01-09 15:57:24,I really cannot watch another season with Canada. I don’t understand how the Steelers just continually replace terrible OCs with someone even worse.
hry6fwr,2022-01-09 15:57:23,Queens hurt
hry6fpz,2022-01-09 15:57:21,BENNY FOR 1 HELL YEAH
hry6fng,2022-01-09 15:57:21,“25+ yard pass play??? Let’s go right back to the run!”
hry6fkd,2022-01-09 15:57:20,Try a different back besides Benny Snell. He’s not that workhorse guy
hry6fdq,2022-01-09 15:57:18,I just want TJ to break that sack record
hry6f9w,2022-01-09 15:57:17,Ya Benny running the bal so it not good
hry6b60,2022-01-09 15:56:38,Can we stop handing it off to Snell for 1 yard per carry.
hry6b52,2022-01-09 15:56:37,Stop running the ficking ball jfc
hry6aod,2022-01-09 15:56:33,Ravens have like the worst pass defense in the league and we running a backup rb into a wall and screens to ray ray
hry6anq,2022-01-09 15:56:33,"Gentry = 81
Pat = 88"
hry6ah0,2022-01-09 15:56:31,WE THREW IT PAST THE LoS AND LOOK WHAT HAPPENS
hry6ad4,2022-01-09 15:56:30,Canada in shambles Ben didn't pass to the RB there
hry6acu,2022-01-09 15:56:30,Man... Snell has been so underwhelming
hry6a2h,2022-01-09 15:56:27,I can't wait to see this run game when teams have to defend the pass with the QB under center
hry69tw,2022-01-09 15:56:25,That pass to Gentry seemed to float in the air for a long time. lol
hry69o6,2022-01-09 15:56:23,Throw the goddamn ball and use your stud tight end
hry69jm,2022-01-09 15:56:22,Any updates on Najee?
hry68zk,2022-01-09 15:56:16,Yes please keep using the TEs it’s so annoying he throw every pass to Ray Ray mcFuck
hry68ez,2022-01-09 15:56:11,Gentry LEADING RECEIVERS
hry68e3,2022-01-09 15:56:10,At least Muuth is on the field
hry65hx,2022-01-09 15:55:43,Benny is so average it’s average
hry655t,2022-01-09 15:55:40,My dream is that we get into the playoffs just long enough to knock the bengals out.  It'll settle for a Watt record though.
hry64t8,2022-01-09 15:55:36,YESSIR A 1 YARD RUN LETS GOOOOOO
hry64l0,2022-01-09 15:55:34,Harbaugh won't let him.
hry64i1,2022-01-09 15:55:33,Great playcall Matt. 1 yd gain. Woooo
hry642p,2022-01-09 15:55:28,Don’t post that publicly the Ravens might get wind Canada’s grand scheme
hry63r5,2022-01-09 15:55:25,[deleted]
hry63qz,2022-01-09 15:55:25,Cause Kalen Ballage is worse than Snell
hry63gr,2022-01-09 15:55:23,What are we trying to prove with Snell?
hry635p,2022-01-09 15:55:20,Don’t forget running back is hurt also
hry6350,2022-01-09 15:55:20,haha they're the best run defense and the worst pass defense. I'm going to become the joker hahahah
hry62j9,2022-01-09 15:55:14,Hyperextended his elbow
hry62ff,2022-01-09 15:55:13,Twisted his elbow real good
hry62di,2022-01-09 15:55:13,"good question, i like ballage over him."
hry5ydq,2022-01-09 15:54:34,Final score might be 3-0
hry5y2r,2022-01-09 15:54:31,What happened to Najee?
hry5xzj,2022-01-09 15:54:30,No please. As much as the ravens would love that lol
hry5xt3,2022-01-09 15:54:29,What happened to Kellen Ballage?  Why is Snell getting all the snaps over Ballage?
hry5xae,2022-01-09 15:54:24,Trevor Lawrence is doing 11-12 100+ yards and a TD. We can’t let him down!

hry5uo5,2022-01-09 15:53:58,"that strip should've been one, that ruling is bullshit"
hry5unt,2022-01-09 15:53:58,"Dude honestly. If you told me since week 12 that he leads the Steelers’ receivers in targets, then I’d totally believe you. McCloud does nothing with them and doesn’t run good routes. He has a few good grabs here and there but he’s a professional receiver so it makes sense. I have no fucking clue why he’s out targeting guys like Claypool and occasionally DJ. I’m so fucking sick of this offense that I’d rather have Todd Haley and Randy Fichtner procreate and their creation as OC would provide more enjoyment."
hry5rs3,2022-01-09 15:53:30,Don‘t we all just want to witness TJ greatness😭
hry5rhf,2022-01-09 15:53:27,Most in a single game all year it feels like
hry5r64,2022-01-09 15:53:24,Screen pass behind the the line for a loss x3
hry5r0r,2022-01-09 15:53:23,"Yeah, it was atleast a sick lick by TJ!"
hry5qsc,2022-01-09 15:53:20,"Could you imagine if two hours from now, the game is still 3-0?"

First rule of football is play till the whistle."
hry5ori,2022-01-09 15:53:00,well that's for sure but I'm fucking sick of receivers throwing hands up begging for a flag
hry5ojf,2022-01-09 15:52:58,Afc north football baby 4 and outs for everyone
hry5ob9,2022-01-09 15:52:56,Ya sure ya don’t want 2 runs up the gut and a pass to ray ray short of the sticks??

hry5j53,2022-01-09 15:52:05,It’s a credit to the defense that we are up in this game because the offensive decision making so far has been absolutely horrendous
hry5iyd,2022-01-09 15:52:03,If he was on the Steelers I wouldn’t complain

hry5hzg,2022-01-09 15:51:54,I don't see Rodolph guiding the sleigh. I look for them to make a splash in FA while they have the cap space.
hry5cur,2022-01-09 15:51:06,"I think the refs are letting close calls play out just in case it was a turnover 

I like that"

hry5b9w,2022-01-09 15:50:50,Well if we do make the playoffs we will not have a team anyways it looks like
hry5b7k,2022-01-09 15:50:50,These announcers are brain dead.
hry5b22,2022-01-09 15:50:48,That female athletic trainer looks thick I love it.
hry5ax3,2022-01-09 15:50:47,Why didn't they blow the fucking whistle?
hry5aw1,2022-01-09 15:50:46,If we somehow squeak into the playoffs it's going to be an absolute bloodbath in the first round.

hry52f2,2022-01-09 15:49:24,Is Ray Ray signed for next year? I never need to see him play football again
hry52ej,2022-01-09 15:49:24,Just give TJ Watt the sack record right now.
hry52c8,2022-01-09 15:49:23,Why we don’t target Pat 10 times a game baffles me
hry4zcu,2022-01-09 15:48:53,that third down call and play was tough because it was so long the ravens knew we had to pass and needed time to develop
hry4yuy,2022-01-09 15:48:49,No?  Just bitching with everyone else
hry4yl7,2022-01-09 15:48:46,Harvin hitting 30 yard punts like a high school 2nd stringer.

hry4y9v,2022-01-09 15:48:43,Okay negative Nancy.
hry4y2f,2022-01-09 15:48:41,Where is waitman?
hry4xx2,2022-01-09 15:48:39,I havent seen Ben throw a hard ball across the middle in a long time.   3rd and long always been short throws.   Shoulder injury???
hry4xt6,2022-01-09 15:48:38,It's funny that the OC gets shit for calling quick passes right after the o-line gets blown up by multiple defenders for a 5 yard loss on a run and not long after Ben threw a horrible deep pass into double coverage.
hry4xat,2022-01-09 15:48:33,I got them at +15.5 on Friday I’m loving that decision lol
hry4x67,2022-01-09 15:48:32,Yeah Big Ben is really going to fire one in on a rope on a 15 yard out or down the seam and our line is going to give him the time for those routes to develop.
hry4x2d,2022-01-09 15:48:31,I don't even know how they are in the NFL let alone playing
hry4wt3,2022-01-09 15:48:29,Probably would've been a decent gain if he didn't have to make a one handed catch low
hry4wig,2022-01-09 15:48:26,Ravens could never see that screen coming lol
hry4wia,2022-01-09 15:48:26,"They were playing soft zone, we could have had an easy 7-9 yard pass, then who knows, maybe you get a fortunate YAC. That's the smart call.

Canada dials up a lateral pass behind the line of scrimmage that the entire defense can see and line up the receiver."
hry4wb6,2022-01-09 15:48:24,The ghost of Todd Haley is loving it.
hry4tej,2022-01-09 15:47:56,I feel like I'm watching Todd Haley 2.0.
hry4td9,2022-01-09 15:47:56,How about not throw it to McCloud on 1st down one-on-one in the open field behind the line of scrimmage and expect him to make something happen? Because that down put the offense behind the sticks for the remainder of the posession. But sure feign ignorance that it was the third down play that was the issue.
hry4t61,2022-01-09 15:47:54,To be fair Queen’s strength is against the run
hry4svx,2022-01-09 15:47:51,Tomlin is calling defense right?
hry4stk,2022-01-09 15:47:51,3rd and short bomb it.  3rd and long screen pass. I don't get it.
hry4skh,2022-01-09 15:47:48,Waitman has Covid
hry4sf3,2022-01-09 15:47:47,No helmet this week

Pittsburgh: 3 points
Fucking barf"
hry4sbk,2022-01-09 15:47:46,What would everyone do on that 3rd down play? With the o line and the corpse of Ben Roethlisberger you're looking at absolutely nothing good happening
hry4rx3,2022-01-09 15:47:42,We forced two turnover and one turnover on downs and put up incredible 3 points.
hry4rgo,2022-01-09 15:47:37,Why is Harvin back in when we did just fine punting on Monday with Waitman?
hry4rgb,2022-01-09 15:47:37,tomlin likes em thiccc
hry4rf3,2022-01-09 15:47:37,I’m so sick of seeing Ray Ray and Benny Snell.
hry4rdh,2022-01-09 15:47:36,Love Ben. And in what might be his last game I hate to say this but we just cannot move the ball well with him back there. He just can’t get the ball down field anymore with accuracy and not having that threat just kills an offense
hry4qxp,2022-01-09 15:47:32,Any more power on that and duvernay leaves it for a touchback
hry4quq,2022-01-09 15:47:31,Big Dan was a legend lol
hry4qlu,2022-01-09 15:47:29,Waitman is so much better than Harvin
hry4qkq,2022-01-09 15:47:29,You could screen a whole porch with Canada’s 3rd down playbook
hry4qk3,2022-01-09 15:47:28,Weak ass third down play as usual. Canada needs to go
hry4q9g,2022-01-09 15:47:26,Do they think Ray Ray is Heinz Ward or something?
hry4q81,2022-01-09 15:47:25,Harvin blows
hry4q4d,2022-01-09 15:47:24,I absolutely hate our 3rd and long playcalling
hry4pp0,2022-01-09 15:47:20,did anyone notice Bush knock the ball out of Edmunds hands on the pick
hry4m1h,2022-01-09 15:46:45,"Rey Rey was targeted on all passing plays that drive, please don’t tell me it’s that type of game."
hry4m15,2022-01-09 15:46:45,Usually he's the one getting sued.
hry4lur,2022-01-09 15:46:43,"Fucking ridiculous, I hate this playcalling"
hry4ltt,2022-01-09 15:46:43,At least we extended our league lead of the throwing behind the line on 3rd and long…
hry4lpj,2022-01-09 15:46:42,"At this point, I have more hope in getting a defensive touchdown."
hry4lme,2022-01-09 15:46:41,Another terrible punt by Harvin.
hry4lkq,2022-01-09 15:46:41,"God , we suck 🤦‍♂️. Seriously, wtf are we gonna do in the playoffs if we would happen to make it other than be embarrassed?"
hry4l90,2022-01-09 15:46:38,If the Jags win and we lose I'm going to lose my god damn mind
hry4l32,2022-01-09 15:46:36,We almost got it with that screen /s
hry4l1n,2022-01-09 15:46:36,This team wastes so much good field position
hry4l1g,2022-01-09 15:46:36,No idea how that wasn’t a fumble
hry4kus,2022-01-09 15:46:34,this is the team steelers fans want to limp into the playoffs.
hry4ktx,2022-01-09 15:46:34,Be alright with that too.  They’re going to have to do something.
hry4krh,2022-01-09 15:46:33,Yeah that was expected
hry4kq7,2022-01-09 15:46:32,It's Canada
hry4klp,2022-01-09 15:46:31,Matt Canada is **dogshit**
hry4kje,2022-01-09 15:46:31,also I love when we just give up on a drive by throwing a screen or running a draw when you need sixteen fucking yards
hry4kg4,2022-01-09 15:46:30,12-10 Steelers
hry4k5v,2022-01-09 15:46:27,If we’re putting the fate of the offense in the hands of Snell & McCloud all day.... it’s going to be a rough one lmaoo
hry4k4c,2022-01-09 15:46:27,Colts kick FG 7-3 Jax
hry4k3p,2022-01-09 15:46:27,Not appreciating this reminder of how much of a band aid Najee is for this offense.
hry4jxk,2022-01-09 15:46:25,Fire Matt Canada.
hry4juv,2022-01-09 15:46:24,"Lol when did Ray Ray become the focal point of the offense? Been incredibly frustrating. He doesn’t suck, but he’s not that guy"
hry4jua,2022-01-09 15:46:24,Stop trying to make McCloud a thing.
hry4jqj,2022-01-09 15:46:23,"I hate Matt Canada…seriously, I don’t care if Ben is shot, the O-line sucks, whatever. They run the most basic pathetic offense I’ve ever seen. Until Ben starts calling plays in the second half."
hry4jon,2022-01-09 15:46:23,We’re the only team that just gives up on 3rd and long
hry4jnn,2022-01-09 15:46:22,I miss our teams that had an amazing offense and dogshit defense. At least those teams weren't boring af to watch
hry4jld,2022-01-09 15:46:22,34 yard punt man I can’t this whole team sucks
hry4jkz,2022-01-09 15:46:22,I want us to win and get in but watching this offense makes me question why.
hry4jk9,2022-01-09 15:46:21,"In this offense, every play is a Ryan Switzer pass."
hry4jg3,2022-01-09 15:46:20,Does Ben see 14 and think it’s 84?  He really misses AB…
hry4jg1,2022-01-09 15:46:20,Honestly neither of these teams should be in the playoffs.
hry4jbb,2022-01-09 15:46:19,literally screaming let's go at the jags gettin the sack lol.
hry4j5p,2022-01-09 15:46:18,"I'm so fucking tired of seeing this same play calling. ""It's third and seventeen let's throw a one yard pass"" might as well run the damn ball at least it wouldn't be expected"
hry4iy5,2022-01-09 15:46:16,These third down plays are just trolling at this point
hry4ioj,2022-01-09 15:46:13,"Nah, too many players missing this season."
hry4idl,2022-01-09 15:46:10,Honestly fuck you Canada. I don’t care who your players are that’s the wrong call. They know you always throw to the sticks there anyway
hry4iby,2022-01-09 15:46:10,"Ah yes, time for another commercial break"
hry4i7z,2022-01-09 15:46:09,Harvin is really bad
hry4i74,2022-01-09 15:46:09,The jags are coming through and we’re fucking it up. So predictable
hry4e2h,2022-01-09 15:45:28,Does Matt Canada really think we're going to win this game featuring Ray Ray Mc-Fucking-Cloud on offense?
hry4e1g,2022-01-09 15:45:28,pass behind the line of scrimmage on 3rd and 16. Fire matt canada into the sun
hry4e0l,2022-01-09 15:45:28,What a display of offensive prowess
hry4e0j,2022-01-09 15:45:28,3RD AND LONG SCREEN FUCKKKKKK
hry4dy3,2022-01-09 15:45:27,Unreal pal…unreal.
hry4dvv,2022-01-09 15:45:27,They have no practice with snell in there
hry4doo,2022-01-09 15:45:24,3rd and 16 4 yard route
hry4do5,2022-01-09 15:45:24,Why the fuck is McCloud getting so many touches
hry4dms,2022-01-09 15:45:24,FFS
hry4dg8,2022-01-09 15:45:22,These are not playoff caliber teams.
hry4dfv,2022-01-09 15:45:22,Fuck you Matt!
hry4de3,2022-01-09 15:45:21,God I hate watching RayRay on offense.
hry4dbq,2022-01-09 15:45:21,Need jags to hold to a fg
hry4d2j,2022-01-09 15:45:18,I miss Najee.
hry4cxs,2022-01-09 15:45:17,Watching this offense sucks
hry4cvp,2022-01-09 15:45:16,wtf lol
hry4co2,2022-01-09 15:45:14,McCloud!
hry4cj0,2022-01-09 15:45:13,JAGS SACK HOLDS COLTS TO 3
hry4chm,2022-01-09 15:45:13,Josh Allen! Sack!
hry4cfy,2022-01-09 15:45:12,Let’s see half the sub blame that on Snell
hry4c5x,2022-01-09 15:45:09,What is this fucking play calling
hry4c2z,2022-01-09 15:45:08,Ohh ok that makes sense. But why is he considered a runner if he can still pass the ball after picking it up? I thought you weren't considered a runner until you crossed the line of scrimmage.
hry4c0u,2022-01-09 15:45:08,The line just standing around going WTF
hry4by7,2022-01-09 15:45:07,Why do we keep running it holy shit man throw the damn ball
hry4bod,2022-01-09 15:45:05,The past few weeks ray ray’s been playing like he really wants to be a part of the offense
hry4bmm,2022-01-09 15:45:04,dear god in heaven
hry4blh,2022-01-09 15:45:04,[deleted]
hry4amd,2022-01-09 15:44:55,"Brother in law moved here from another country.  Exposed to NFL for the first time...  ""Why is it all commercials?""  Welcome to US and A"
hry4al9,2022-01-09 15:44:55,What's the final score going to be?
hry47wi,2022-01-09 15:44:30,"Harbaugh is such a dog shit coach.  Got carried by Ozzie Newsome giving him top shelf talent all the time.  Left to figure football out for himself, he puts running backs at quarterback and sits the best kicker in history on the sidelines so his RB's can try to throw for two, over and over again.  That fake was classic Harbaugh.

I want a long and prosperous future full of Harbaugh, Stefanski, Lamar, and Baker.  We'll have to figure something out about Cinci, but historically, that hasn't been too hard a code to crack."
hry47vu,2022-01-09 15:44:30,When did Ray Ray become Jerry Rice?
hry47q8,2022-01-09 15:44:28,Lol Ray Ray is the best WR on the team I guess
hry47na,2022-01-09 15:44:28,Why the fuck are we trying to feature Ray Ray McCloud. Who cares if he has little 1-handed catches. He does nothing before or after the catch.
hry47kf,2022-01-09 15:44:27,Screen play is Ben worst play
hry47dy,2022-01-09 15:44:25,FR they could have 11 wins if he wasn't such a bone head.
hry47av,2022-01-09 15:44:24,Basically a screen with no blockers.  brilliant.
hry477l,2022-01-09 15:44:23,Great play call Canada. Please hire a new OC.
hry476z,2022-01-09 15:44:23,It was like three years ago we were saying imagine this offense with a competent defense
hry46kh,2022-01-09 15:44:17,"Yeah, respect for that tbh"
hry45w2,2022-01-09 15:44:10,what the fuck is their obsession with ray ray
hry45lq,2022-01-09 15:44:07,This is the 3rd time the offense starts with good field position. Offense better do something
hry44wm,2022-01-09 15:44:00,I feel an unhealthy use of Ray Ray this drive.
hry44na,2022-01-09 15:43:58,Aborted snap and subjectivity of Huntley trying to run. That's not ruled a sack by the rules.
hry44fx,2022-01-09 15:43:56,T-Law about to have the game of his career.  11-11 100+ yards 1 TD.
hry41py,2022-01-09 15:43:29,"At the 50, I could see it.   Deep in your own zone?  Nah."
hry41my,2022-01-09 15:43:28,You’re fun….
hry41mm,2022-01-09 15:43:28,The Snap was aborted and Huntley picked it up and tried to continue the play. Watt got there and stripped it but because it was an aborted play (and Huntley looked like he might try to run) they only gave him credit for the tackle and forced fumble.
hry41aq,2022-01-09 15:43:25,Same lmfao i was like watch these fuckers fake
hry418r,2022-01-09 15:43:25,We’ve been saying that for 3 seasons now lol. I’m afraid it won’t happen
hry4161,2022-01-09 15:43:24,He always finds new creative ways to stall the offense out.
hry40nq,2022-01-09 15:43:19,"That’s interesting to me though. Say he scrambled outside of the pocket still looking to pass… you’d have to rule that a sack, right?"
hry4000,2022-01-09 15:43:13,Hate the ravens but love the pair of danglers harbaugh has between his legs. Wish more coaches had the guts to call stuff like that
hry3zyt,2022-01-09 15:43:12,"Everyone knew that fake was coming, why not line up and go for it with offense?"
hry3zng,2022-01-09 15:43:09,"Harbaugh's constant need to be ""unpredictable"" is the most predictable thing in the league lmao"
hry3zk6,2022-01-09 15:43:08,"Canada threw that pick, face it Ben has been ABYSMAL. He's going to have to majorly step up his game if they want to win"
hry3zj0,2022-01-09 15:43:07,Pandering to the “woke” community
hry3z96,2022-01-09 15:43:05,"Nope, got a first"
hry3z6k,2022-01-09 15:43:04,Guess is because he was already kinda falling but yeah even if he touched him down it should be a sack.
hry3z4w,2022-01-09 15:43:04,"If you're a team that thinks they are the under dog, it makes sense to go for higher risk higher reward type plays."
hry3yz0,2022-01-09 15:43:02,Except there's no fucking way in hell the Ravens put Tucker out to get killed
hry3yrh,2022-01-09 15:43:00,Fuckinnn what? They telegraphed the shit out of that lol
hry3ycm,2022-01-09 15:42:56,My favorite part of this season is Harbaugh just throwing games away for no reason

hry3rgf,2022-01-09 15:41:49,Not sure that guy knew it was a fake and got leveled
hry3nms,2022-01-09 15:41:12,He won 15 straight as a rookie. I'd take that for a change.
hry3nj0,2022-01-09 15:41:11,"I'm all for giving a guy chances but Holy fuck it's been bad. Our offense isn't great, but the talent shouldn't be a bottom unit like they are."

hry2opl,2022-01-09 15:35:34,Ballage turns around and does his job the interception never happens. Gotta help your QB out there.
hry2o2s,2022-01-09 15:35:28,"The classic don’t throw ball out just chuck it up and if it’s intercepted then it’s a punt 

If you don’t like that you don’t like Big Ben football"
hry2mqo,2022-01-09 15:35:15,The fact that there are people out there thinking that this INT is on RayRay is crazy.
hry2mn8,2022-01-09 15:35:14,Just heard announcers say he's probable to return - has a brace on his elbow now
hry2iy4,2022-01-09 15:34:38,Classic shit Ben and Canada play throwing in double coverage to McCloud. Has he ever heard of a throw away?
hry2id2,2022-01-09 15:34:33,I may be missing the sarcasm here but Washington is on the COVID list
hry2i1d,2022-01-09 15:34:29,He wasn’t.
hry2hx0,2022-01-09 15:34:28,Said nobody ever
hry2hs2,2022-01-09 15:34:27,Ray Ray is not that guy lol
hry2h84,2022-01-09 15:34:21,Just from that throwing motion I knew a pick was coming. Serious lack of confidence behind that throw
hry2h19,2022-01-09 15:34:20,Nailed it. Ugh this team in the first half is so mind boggling. Ravens literally playing 4th stringers in the secondary
hry2gwo,2022-01-09 15:34:19,"not a great throw by ben, but what was mccloud doing there hand fighting with the db instead of tracking the ball?"
hry2gk6,2022-01-09 15:34:15,Thanks Ben?
hry2gh0,2022-01-09 15:34:14,Solid arm punt
hry2ggi,2022-01-09 15:34:14,Dumb ass play to send it to Ray Ray but it isn't like Claypool is catching a goddamn pass any time soon so I guess I get it?
hry2g85,2022-01-09 15:34:12,Joined game late what happened to Najee?
hry2fwo,2022-01-09 15:34:09,Throwing to Ray Ray in double coverage is counter-productive
hry2fwh,2022-01-09 15:34:09,That was an obvious pick the moment it left his hand. Just looked off.
hry2ft6,2022-01-09 15:34:08,"Ahh, thats nice to see. Ben hasn't been arm punting much lately"
hry2fn3,2022-01-09 15:34:06,"It’s okay to throw the ball away on 1st and 10, Ben"
hry2fer,2022-01-09 15:34:04,Nice punt
hry2f8i,2022-01-09 15:34:03,"To be fair Ray Ray McCloud is basically Randy Moss, you gotta give it a shot. 

I just want TJ to get the record and get us out of this season so we can move on with our lives with a new QB. Sick of watching this shit."
hry2cri,2022-01-09 15:33:39,"I can’t stand Ray Ray, but that floater was painful to watch"
hry2cqw,2022-01-09 15:33:39,ben dont wanna make the playoffs he ready for the couch
hry2cqt,2022-01-09 15:33:39,"Bottom 2 offense, not 2"
hry2cpv,2022-01-09 15:33:39,The old throw it up and let the great ray ray McCloud make a play.
hry2cjb,2022-01-09 15:33:37,Haven't seen an arm punt in a while
hry2c91,2022-01-09 15:33:34,Lol that's all he can do st this point of the season.
hry2c6i,2022-01-09 15:33:33,"Ray Ray is not the guy

Edit. And that was an atrocious decision. What the fuck"
hry2c4z,2022-01-09 15:33:33,Nice punt Ben.
hry2c4i,2022-01-09 15:33:33,That interception was in slow motion.
hry2c4b,2022-01-09 15:33:33,[deleted]
hry2byl,2022-01-09 15:33:31,That was horrible haha
hry2bxu,2022-01-09 15:33:31,Classic 2021 Steelers football baby
hry2bvw,2022-01-09 15:33:30,I have zero hopes for a competitive game if this team makes the playoffs lol
hry2bsg,2022-01-09 15:33:29,Just bad pass and bad decision Ben....
hry2bsf,2022-01-09 15:33:29,That was fucking stupid
hry2brs,2022-01-09 15:33:29,Wtf was that Ben
hry2br0,2022-01-09 15:33:29,It was as good as we could have expected the punt to be a few plays later.
hry2bqg,2022-01-09 15:33:29,As soon as he threw it I knew it was gonna be a pick…
hry2bqb,2022-01-09 15:33:29,Awful throw. Time to take Old Yeller out back.
hry2bq3,2022-01-09 15:33:29,"Ben..wtf, why? That had INT written all over it, throwing like that…"
hry2bp3,2022-01-09 15:33:28,What the fuck was that throw man
hry2bor,2022-01-09 15:33:28,God Ben looks bad
hry2bn1,2022-01-09 15:33:28,Please play Washington more than McCloud. This is ridiculous that he’s not getting the ball.
hry2bmz,2022-01-09 15:33:28,What a horrible decision
hry2bmu,2022-01-09 15:33:28,That’s ray-ray Ben not claypool. At least claypool could have knocked it out of play
hry2bgs,2022-01-09 15:33:26,It would be fitting if the Steelers snuck in and won the Super Bowl. It would be a fitting full circle ending to Ben's career.
hry2bey,2022-01-09 15:33:26,"It’s almost as if McCloud shouldn’t be on the field, let alone the team, let alone the league."
hry2bab,2022-01-09 15:33:24,The good old fuck it diontae down there somewhere
hry2b68,2022-01-09 15:33:23,Cmon Ben.... That's a rookie throw in your final game
hry2b4n,2022-01-09 15:33:23,had muth open goddamit ben
hry2ayu,2022-01-09 15:33:21,Terrible decision by Ben
hry2ayn,2022-01-09 15:33:21,If Ray Ray had been running rather than waiting...
hry2ay3,2022-01-09 15:33:21,Looks like the TEs will be the difference today.
hry2atf,2022-01-09 15:33:20,IS THIS HOW YOU WANNA GO OUT BEN?
hry2anm,2022-01-09 15:33:18,Not a great throw but it looks like he stopped his route short.
hry2agm,2022-01-09 15:33:17,Ben said fuck it
hry2ac1,2022-01-09 15:33:16,"God Ben, what are you doing?"
hry2aa2,2022-01-09 15:33:15,Come on Ben. Just floated it to em
hry2a4c,2022-01-09 15:33:13,Yeah man who could've seen Kalen Ballage forgetting he's supposed to be Ben's checkdown?
hry2a2m,2022-01-09 15:33:13,"no flow with this offense at all man, like cmon"
hry2a1v,2022-01-09 15:33:13,Tf
hry2a0y,2022-01-09 15:33:13,That’s classic Ben right there
hry29wx,2022-01-09 15:33:12,"Jesus Ben come on, what does Ray ray have on you"
hry29v0,2022-01-09 15:33:11,"WTF was that...

RB just sat there blocking nobody with an open side of the field Ben looks RB is dumb and then Ben does that shit"
hry29u7,2022-01-09 15:33:11,Ah shit my stream is behind
hry29tw,2022-01-09 15:33:11,Forcing a terrible throw down field. Ben wtf man.
hry29rm,2022-01-09 15:33:10,Lol to the people that still think Ben is good for the team
hry29lx,2022-01-09 15:33:09,I thought Ben was done floating passes down the field into double coverage
hry29jj,2022-01-09 15:33:08,What was he trying to do on that throw lol
hry29c4,2022-01-09 15:33:06,Well that was a horrible play and pass
hry295r,2022-01-09 15:33:04,"Forcing the ball to Ray Ray McCloud. Yeah, that makes sense."
hry2944,2022-01-09 15:33:04,"hysterical. double coverage overthrow instead of throwing it to the sidelines. that damn todd haley, I mean fichtner, oh I mean canada"
hry292d,2022-01-09 15:33:04,It's really time for Ben unfortunately.
hry291m,2022-01-09 15:33:03,It’s fine CHILL
hry26n5,2022-01-09 15:32:40,YIKES
hry26kn,2022-01-09 15:32:39,Kalen Ballage can be blamed for that INT. What a moron.
hry26ju,2022-01-09 15:32:39,C’mon Ben
hry26i1,2022-01-09 15:32:39,Ben out here like playoffs?!? I'm just trying to retire
hry26hg,2022-01-09 15:32:38,"Ben, why?"
hry26fk,2022-01-09 15:32:38,Jesus Ben what a horrible fucking decision
hry25vy,2022-01-09 15:32:33,50/50 ball to Ray Ray? WTF?
hry25q2,2022-01-09 15:32:31,Ben what the actual fuck
hry2579,2022-01-09 15:32:26,You were saying?
hry252u,2022-01-09 15:32:25,Omfg Ben you moron

hry24tb,2022-01-09 15:32:22,"Overslept thanks to working nights and finally getting back after recovering from COVID.

But I wake up to see an interception on the Ravens and the Jags are up on the Colts!

Dogs are in their jerseys, I've got my Hodges jersey on, Steelers socks are on, towel is in hand, and got some good weed ground up for the morning.

Let's fucking go!"
hry24d8,2022-01-09 15:32:18,"I just want someone to explain the rule to me and why it exists. If he fumbles he can still throw the ball. He's not outside the tackles running towards the line; he's standing up looking downfield. 

If the scoring rule was followed correctly, I want to know why it exists and what it adds to the sport. 

They need to go line by line and audit the rules; there is so much stupid useless shit lol"
hry23l6,2022-01-09 15:32:10,I was thinking the exact same thing big boy don't worry.
hry23k3,2022-01-09 15:32:10,"Jacksonville, you sons of bitches, don’t give us hope."
hry1zw2,2022-01-09 15:31:34,"And that our rushing offense is 31st, while passing is 16th?"
hry1zow,2022-01-09 15:31:32,Mark Andrews is so good.  My go to fantasy TE.  I wish he played for anyone else ha like maybe the Steelers
hry1zo0,2022-01-09 15:31:32,"Absolutely nobody: ….

Me: Did you know TJ Watt missed 3 games and STILL got to 20 sacks?"
hry1yps,2022-01-09 15:31:23,Stop fucking running man

hry1yax,2022-01-09 15:31:19,Trying to keep the run because of that rain.
hry1y4m,2022-01-09 15:31:17,"It looked like a hyper extended elbow, maybe. No word yet"

hry1xqd,2022-01-09 15:31:13,The fact that Najee is probable is insane.
hry1xn4,2022-01-09 15:31:12,Pass short of the sticks incoming

Why don’t we run it AGAIN with our backup RB"

hry1wwq,2022-01-09 15:31:05,Can anyone see Diontae on the field?
hry1wvi,2022-01-09 15:31:04,We are playing one of the worst secondaries and we are running on first and second down. Are we trying to lose?
hry1vvh,2022-01-09 15:30:55,Balt is last is pass d why are we running
hry1t50,2022-01-09 15:30:28,Hurt his hand or arm on the first drive.
hry1t3l,2022-01-09 15:30:27,"I know but not every single snap that he's out there. It's normal every now. They've even been lining the FB on his side, they don't want to get the record"
hry1t1f,2022-01-09 15:30:27,Too bad Canada didn't
hry1sxj,2022-01-09 15:30:26,How did Najee get hurt? Was it bad? And also how the FUCK was that not a strip sack by TJ..
hry1stk,2022-01-09 15:30:25,Edmunds
hry1sro,2022-01-09 15:30:24,Why do we always run on first and second
hry1sp1,2022-01-09 15:30:23,What the fuck are you doing Canada????
hry1sg4,2022-01-09 15:30:21,Can't have two turnovers and only get 6 points
hry1sef,2022-01-09 15:30:21,You stupid idiot u/Shady319 why would you check the score of that game and get your hopes up you stop doing that shit right now
hry1s9w,2022-01-09 15:30:19,"Even if Andrews didn't touch him, it should be a pick,interception, fumble recovery"
hry1rh1,2022-01-09 15:30:11,He had control when the raven touched him. Hes down. Dropping it after means nothinf
hry1qzq,2022-01-09 15:30:06,We always have the 4th quarter.
hry1q4m,2022-01-09 15:29:58,"Why? He caught it then was touched dow , and dropped it"
hry1q0c,2022-01-09 15:29:57,I’ll be honest I’m only watching to hopefully see Watt get the sack record
hry1prb,2022-01-09 15:29:55,"Yeah I meant reversed, not incomplete, my bad"
hry1ppi,2022-01-09 15:29:54,"Yeah, he's been playing hurt all season. Also it looks like we're playing more nickel and dime this game, which is pretty much determined by what offensive packages the Rat Birds send in."
hry1mjx,2022-01-09 15:29:22,He was touched down tho when he had control so play should be dead before the drop
hry1mg7,2022-01-09 15:29:21,I'm happy to be wrong
hry1m0h,2022-01-09 15:29:17,"He didn't, he sat two plays."
hry1lnl,2022-01-09 15:29:13,It’s an INT. He was down by contact. Whatever happened after Andrews touched him is irrelevant because the play is over
hry1lb0,2022-01-09 15:29:09,TJ's sack wasn't a sack based on the rules. We'll consider it the 20.5th sack as opposed to the Baker slide.
hry1kpi,2022-01-09 15:29:03,"I think so, especially after the last play his arm took a beating making that tackle attempt"
hry1kop,2022-01-09 15:29:03,Going between both games is hard work 😂😂
hry1kkf,2022-01-09 15:29:02,No volume on the TV at our gym. But thank you
hry1je0,2022-01-09 15:28:50,Has anyone every seen a mason jersey at a home game?
hry1g6a,2022-01-09 15:28:18,Clean pick and then touched.
hry1g4x,2022-01-09 15:28:18,"Anything AFTER that touch (when he starts losing the ball) shouldn't count, because you counted him down. So it should stand.

However, TJ's sack wasn't a sack so who fucking knows. 🙄"
hry1g16,2022-01-09 15:28:17,Even ol brick hands catches one every once in awhile
hry1g11,2022-01-09 15:28:17,That is an interception.
hry1fxn,2022-01-09 15:28:16,"Ben definitely wanted him out, but someone was like ""We ain't got nobody else!""

He just said aww fuck and moved on LOL."
hry1fv9,2022-01-09 15:28:15,I've never actually seen a play like this
hry1frn,2022-01-09 15:28:14,Trevor Lawrence will save us! He should have his career breakout today
hry1fhq,2022-01-09 15:28:11,Andrews touches him down before the bobbling. He caught that with both of his wrists...
hry1fgx,2022-01-09 15:28:11,Did not look clean at all but I imagine he'd be down by contact as soon as he snagged the ball and before he dropped it so then its a pick? Otherwise if he wasn't touched that was dropped 100% imo
hry1fdn,2022-01-09 15:28:10,"Pardon my ignorance, but why does Watt spend so much time on the sideline? Are they limiting his snaps for an injury concern? Just resting so he doesn’t get gassed?"
hry1fcf,2022-01-09 15:28:10,HOLY SHIT
hry1fap,2022-01-09 15:28:10,Incomplete is not an option.
hry1f77,2022-01-09 15:28:09,The ravens need another team besides the jags to win aswell but I don't remember which
hry1euk,2022-01-09 15:28:05,Interception!!
hry1ete,2022-01-09 15:28:05,GOOD SHIT EDMUNDS
hry1elv,2022-01-09 15:28:03,"Andrews touched him down before he dropped it, our ball."
hry1eld,2022-01-09 15:28:03,Thanks Mandrews
hry1egi,2022-01-09 15:28:01,Holy fuck that was the best play of Edmunds career
hry1eez,2022-01-09 15:28:01,"He was touched, this might actually stand"
hry1e61,2022-01-09 15:27:59,Jags just stopped the colts on 4th. Come on Trevor!!!
hry1dye,2022-01-09 15:27:57,Jags moving down the field again
hry1dwq,2022-01-09 15:27:56,Damn Andrews touching him is rotten luck for them
hry1dw2,2022-01-09 15:27:56,Thats a pretty normal thing for a team to do
hry1dtd,2022-01-09 15:27:55,I think this might stand?
hry1doh,2022-01-09 15:27:54,Downed by contact. Pitt ball
hry1dkx,2022-01-09 15:27:53,Anything on that neck tackle in the return?
hry1dcz,2022-01-09 15:27:51,Why did TJ sit that series?
hry1d8x,2022-01-09 15:27:50,Hilarious. Touched him at the exact right time!
hry1d8s,2022-01-09 15:27:50,HOLY SHIT BOYS
hry1d0n,2022-01-09 15:27:47,Edmunds is not good at football
hry1cwt,2022-01-09 15:27:46,Bush knocked it out 🤦‍♂️
hry1cq5,2022-01-09 15:27:45,They’re doubling him because  he’s the DPOY lol
hry1cji,2022-01-09 15:27:43,no chance in hippie hell thats a pick lol.
hry1cj4,2022-01-09 15:27:43,Edmunds looked like he held on long enough & then was touched by Andrews
hry1ch5,2022-01-09 15:27:43,Why was TJ on the sideline
hry19ac,2022-01-09 15:27:13,WOOOOOOOO LAD
hry18jw,2022-01-09 15:27:06,That’s a pick!!!

hry17s2,2022-01-09 15:26:58,Nope
hry173z,2022-01-09 15:26:52,Nope.  :(
hry15zs,2022-01-09 15:26:41,He got that
hry12nx,2022-01-09 15:26:08,True. Dumb.
hry12cu,2022-01-09 15:26:05,👌
hry12bl,2022-01-09 15:26:05,"Didn't he drop that?

That's a good catch, he had it secured"
hry123n,2022-01-09 15:26:03,"Come on, Jags!"
hry10hd,2022-01-09 15:25:48,Hayward looks like a big great white out there
hry10gu,2022-01-09 15:25:48,Loudermilk is eating
hry10at,2022-01-09 15:25:46,Love Watt celebrating a 10th sack on the season for Heyward while on the sideline!
hry0zzq,2022-01-09 15:25:43,That’s not a sack either right? That’s an aborted play.
hry0z6a,2022-01-09 15:25:36,He definitely falls into the diva category. But his gameplay hasn’t really backed it up this season.
hry0yxy,2022-01-09 15:25:34,That should have been watts sack.
hry0vur,2022-01-09 15:25:05,JAGS 4th down stop! Let’s go!
hry0v61,2022-01-09 15:24:58,Jets fan rooting for y’all jags stopped titans on fourth and 2
hry0v51,2022-01-09 15:24:58,Jaguars with a huge stop on 4th down

hry0u04,2022-01-09 15:24:47,"It's a dirty little secret that the Ravens stats guys used to pad Ray Lewis' stats during every home game. 

Now they're not giving TJ a sack there? Bullshit.

I hope their franchise disbands. I hope Bisciotti goes bankrupt in hilariously embarrassing fashion. Fuck 'em."
hry0tpg,2022-01-09 15:24:44,9 minutes in and I already know this week’s Days of our Steelers will cause indigestion.
hry0tgf,2022-01-09 15:24:42,DUVAL stop!
hry0slq,2022-01-09 15:24:34,Indy gets a turnover on downs
hry0od8,2022-01-09 15:23:53,Good point.  We've seen that song and dance far too many times this season.
hry0o34,2022-01-09 15:23:50,And questionable spot on DJ's play
hry0nec,2022-01-09 15:23:43,Actually not a bad idea. Wonder if we see he and highsmith rotate a bit
hry0mjc,2022-01-09 15:23:34,WATTMANIA LETS GO
hry0iil,2022-01-09 15:22:54,He doesn't know how to attack anyone past 3 yards of the line.
hry0igh,2022-01-09 15:22:53,Does Harris have a broken arm?
hry0icw,2022-01-09 15:22:52,More opportunities for sack now.
hry0i6j,2022-01-09 15:22:50,Not so sure that false start didn't save us 3 points. They were probably gonna stuff us.
hry0i4z,2022-01-09 15:22:50,"not on a fumble if they dont try to throw it after recovery, they are treated as a runner"
hry0hv6,2022-01-09 15:22:47,Yeah figured they would cause broken play.  Not surprised they did
hry0hof,2022-01-09 15:22:45,How is that a give up play? If Watt isn't there ti finish it then the ball isn't out. I'm confused.
hry0gjx,2022-01-09 15:22:35,https://twitter.com/PFF_Steelers/status/1480241648701423618?t=N6mXpk-jgDOkMY7i56PeoQ&s=19
hry0g3d,2022-01-09 15:22:30,agreeeeed
hry0g0r,2022-01-09 15:22:29,Tom Brady has a micropenis I’m so sick of this Man in The Arena commercial already
hry0frz,2022-01-09 15:22:27,Yep
hry0fok,2022-01-09 15:22:26,So did they not give Watt the sack???
hry0fie,2022-01-09 15:22:24,Any chance that sack gets changed later? Seemed like he clearly controlled the ball after picking it up to me.
hry0f7z,2022-01-09 15:22:21,bro shut up
hry0bg6,2022-01-09 15:21:45,Put his arm down during a 3rd down tackle and it twisted his elbow/forearm pretty nasty. He was in pretty big pain but jumped off the field. Status is still unknown but they were putting a sleeve on him at one point.
hry0bej,2022-01-09 15:21:44,Guys maybe chill on Benny I’m not thrilled about that either but under normal circumstances he would have never been in that position anyways
hry0ba5,2022-01-09 15:21:43,Thanks!!
hry0ayi,2022-01-09 15:21:40,And it's only been 20 minutes. Heard the QB is leaving the team after the game too
hry0afq,2022-01-09 15:21:35,"They're convenient for pulling up/down. Additionally, in the cold, they provide a lot of warmth. I wore them at work even before COVID just for that reason."
hry0a08,2022-01-09 15:21:30,It only Steelers football when everyone get Injured and we make the playoffs
hry09wn,2022-01-09 15:21:29,Is muth still out?
hry09wg,2022-01-09 15:21:29,injured his hand or something
hry09u4,2022-01-09 15:21:29,🕯🙏🏼 Claypool redemption game 🙏🏼🕯
hry09r8,2022-01-09 15:21:28,Yep
hry09ox,2022-01-09 15:21:27,Shoutout to Benny Snell for putting points on the board
hry09nx,2022-01-09 15:21:27,"Haha literally strips Huntley. That's some Bs. I'm fine with no sack, but he definitely stripped him"
hry09j2,2022-01-09 15:21:26,Before wentz has even been on the field lol
hry09es,2022-01-09 15:21:24,Alright let's just stop all the games right now. I see no need to continue
hry09bf,2022-01-09 15:21:24,lol its a long game.  dont get too excited yet
hry08yf,2022-01-09 15:21:20,And put….Derek Watt at RB?
hry08qu,2022-01-09 15:21:18,OK TJ time to get that sack back
hry08mo,2022-01-09 15:21:17,Bc it's Benny Snell
hry08kx,2022-01-09 15:21:16,Ok. Time for tj to get another sack. (First one counts to me Idc what the NFL says)
hry08d7,2022-01-09 15:21:14,"Jags up 7-0, we’re up 3-0

*don’t get your hopes up don’t get your hopes up*"
hry08ao,2022-01-09 15:21:13,Cracked ribs.  He and TJ will just swap rib protectors every switch of possession.
hry07yx,2022-01-09 15:21:10,the one time we weren’t gonna live in our fears 🤦🏽‍♂️
hry07xi,2022-01-09 15:21:10,"Yes, strip/sack"
hry07sy,2022-01-09 15:21:09,Been running better than Harris was before he got injured.
hry0546,2022-01-09 15:20:43,How does a running back get a false start?
hry050z,2022-01-09 15:20:42,For whom
hry04wp,2022-01-09 15:20:41,They said no he never had possession
hry04rr,2022-01-09 15:20:39,A guy landed on his arm.
hry04ml,2022-01-09 15:20:38,Campbell the Giant probably would've stopped Snell again anyway
hry04hc,2022-01-09 15:20:37,Jacksonville is winning i can’t this is so funny
hry04c6,2022-01-09 15:20:35,[deleted]
hry041t,2022-01-09 15:20:32,They’re calling it an “aborted play”
hry03xa,2022-01-09 15:20:31,We might get in but we're broken
hry03ki,2022-01-09 15:20:27,False start on 4th & inches. That's a penalty that tends to change the outcome of games.
hry03d5,2022-01-09 15:20:25,They say no. I wonder if that can be later corrected though.
hry03co,2022-01-09 15:20:25,Whoops
hry031a,2022-01-09 15:20:22,I want a BIG BEN running TD today
hry0315,2022-01-09 15:20:22,I would love to see how many pre snap penalties we have on 3 and 4th down. It’s gotta be ridiculously high.
hry0307,2022-01-09 15:20:22,All that stupid fucking motion...qb keeper gets that every time
hry02ms,2022-01-09 15:20:18,I guess because he already fumbled and picked it back up
hry02fv,2022-01-09 15:20:16,Is Tomlin always wearing a gaiter because he's not vacc'd or something?
hry02an,2022-01-09 15:20:15,Me too take them points!!
hry01zq,2022-01-09 15:20:12,My only hope for 22-23 season is we start converting TDs not FGs in the redzone.
hry01s6,2022-01-09 15:20:10,False start as a RB. Can't make this shit up. Bench him already.
hry01pa,2022-01-09 15:20:09,Go jags baby
hry01m5,2022-01-09 15:20:08,Son of a bastard.

hrxzxft,2022-01-09 15:19:28,The Steeler way
hrxzx9i,2022-01-09 15:19:26,Does the sack count?
hrxzx7i,2022-01-09 15:19:26,how the fuck does the RB jump on a play that he's gonna get the ball
hrxzx7g,2022-01-09 15:19:26,Right you are Ken.  Still plenty of time to get a couple more.
hrxzwlg,2022-01-09 15:19:20,Well.  Being on BOZGAWD
hrxzw1x,2022-01-09 15:19:15,Come on bro

hrxzvl4,2022-01-09 15:19:10,"Fucking false start. Come on, Benny"
hrxzvb0,2022-01-09 15:19:07,So the Ravens win by just injuring the whole team?
hrxzvay,2022-01-09 15:19:07,No sack bs and no penalty for the helmet contact on dj
hrxzrlt,2022-01-09 15:18:30,Gonna need more Derek action if this holds up
hrxzrer,2022-01-09 15:18:29,did yinz know Justin Tucker can sing opera ? impressive ngl
hrxzrdy,2022-01-09 15:18:28,Somebody tell TJ about that bullshit. Get him into Extra Hulk Mode
hrxzrdn,2022-01-09 15:18:28,"I think najee will be ok. The way they were talking it wasn’t too bad. Diontae on the other hand, that might be some cracked/broken ribs"
hrxzr3f,2022-01-09 15:18:25,I mean if Favre can lie on the ground to give Strahan a sack how is Huntley having full possession of the ball and trying to scramble not a sack?
hrxzqdp,2022-01-09 15:18:18,Aborted play? That’s a sack. Huntley grabbed the ball.
hrxzqc7,2022-01-09 15:18:18,"If it was an aborted play, he would have been down when he covered the ball. He was trying to get back up and was sacked and fumbled.  Fucking horseshit."
hrxzq9i,2022-01-09 15:18:17,"Yeah, we need to win this game."
hrxzq8f,2022-01-09 15:18:17,Home of Challenge Pissing!
hrxzq3w,2022-01-09 15:18:16,Yup
hrxzq38,2022-01-09 15:18:16,It might work.
hrxzpso,2022-01-09 15:18:13,And just like that we have to rely on snell/claypool/ mccloud. It’s been a good season boys!
hrxzpp5,2022-01-09 15:18:12,DARE TO BELIEVE IN THE JAGS????!!!!
hrxzphh,2022-01-09 15:18:10,"If you don't like limping into the playoffs, you don't like Stillers fooball."
hrxzpfw,2022-01-09 15:18:09,Lmao no one is acting tough…. relax
hrxzpet,2022-01-09 15:18:09,Wow so no sack because baltimore hates us?
hrxzosg,2022-01-09 15:18:03,"That ravens O-line is ass, TJ will get more chances"
hrxzopt,2022-01-09 15:18:02,Yo how the fuck is that not a sack?
hrxzoi1,2022-01-09 15:18:00,"They give Straham the sack record when Favre falls down on purpose, but dont give it to TJ when he makes a legitimate play..."
hrxzo7q,2022-01-09 15:17:58,Hah. Yeah we need to win this game.
hrxzo5j,2022-01-09 15:17:57,TOUCHDOWN JAGS
hrxzkk8,2022-01-09 15:17:22,Do the rules say that should be a penalty since he dropped his head and hit DJ crown first?
hrxzkai,2022-01-09 15:17:19,Any good sites to watch the jags on the phone while watching the Steelers on the tv?
hrxzk9s,2022-01-09 15:17:19,lol the jags up a score.. now I have to pay attention this afternoon.  *cracks beer let’s go
hrxzk5q,2022-01-09 15:17:18,That’s a spear isn’t it

hrxzjth,2022-01-09 15:17:15,Let’s give Big Ben one last QB sneak
hrxzjd2,2022-01-09 15:17:11,So even if we do make the playoffs we’ll be without najee and diontae…
hrxzj3u,2022-01-09 15:17:08,Yes.

hrxzdk7,2022-01-09 15:16:13,I hate Ravens week.
hrxzd7o,2022-01-09 15:16:10,"more of a college football guy, but that looked like a spear to me if such a rule exists in the NFL"
hrxzd4c,2022-01-09 15:16:09,Villanova has one job today: let Watt get that record.
hrxzcz7,2022-01-09 15:16:08,Right in the ribs.
hrxzcxv,2022-01-09 15:16:08,"Aborted play, not a sack.

hrxzc5i,2022-01-09 15:16:00,Hopefully he just got the wind knocked out of him.
hrxzc2x,2022-01-09 15:15:59,No sack for TJ
hrxzbnv,2022-01-09 15:15:55,SCORE!

hrxzbeu,2022-01-09 15:15:53,scored
hrxzavf,2022-01-09 15:15:48,Harris now diontae
hrxz6zv,2022-01-09 15:15:11,I think it's alot on the center. Green would make plays dead in the water by losing ground.
hrxz6xi,2022-01-09 15:15:10,Bastards.
hrxz6ui,2022-01-09 15:15:09,No sack for TJ

hrxz5vw,2022-01-09 15:15:00,I think it’s the center personally.
hrxz5v8,2022-01-09 15:14:59,Claypool ran too far upfield for a Canada 3 yard pass
hrxz5eu,2022-01-09 15:14:55,Jaguars knocking on the door of the goal line.
hrxz56u,2022-01-09 15:14:52,Lol Claypool gave thay guy a hi-five.
hrxz497,2022-01-09 15:14:43,Not a sack? Morons
hrxz3z5,2022-01-09 15:14:40,Consensus from who?
hrxz3i3,2022-01-09 15:14:35,Najee did not look good on the sideline
hrxz0sz,2022-01-09 15:14:09,Let's go Benny earn some snaps next year.
hrxz0fb,2022-01-09 15:14:05,"Ok, seriously, is it: the center, the o-line coach or the defenses?

Our run game has looked way different the past two weeks."
hrxz0c2,2022-01-09 15:14:04,SOUNDS LIKE A HOME GAME!
hrxz05x,2022-01-09 15:14:02,How is it not a sack?
hrxyzh6,2022-01-09 15:13:55,Nasty stinger Najee got. We all done that before playing sports. Hopefully isn’t too shaken up.
hrxyzcz,2022-01-09 15:13:54,"My man Leglue out there bleeding on the left shoulder, doesn't give a shit."
hrxyz88,2022-01-09 15:13:53,Are they not crediting TJ with that strip sack?
hrxyz7o,2022-01-09 15:13:53,The ravens didn’t fall for the snell handoffs last time. This time they don’t have a chance lol
hrxyyr9,2022-01-09 15:13:48,Snell running on fresh legs.
hrxyxf8,2022-01-09 15:13:35,"I’ve done it, you’re fine in the stadium it’s walking back to your car that’s the issue."
hrxytrh,2022-01-09 15:12:59,That's a sack. Huntley picked it back up before getting hit.
hrxyto3,2022-01-09 15:12:58,The ballsack strip sack!
hrxytie,2022-01-09 15:12:56,Bens gonna have to throw 500 times in the rain on his last game. Snell only took 60 seconds to get to the outside there.
hrxythf,2022-01-09 15:12:56,15 games
hrxyt5j,2022-01-09 15:12:53,Zaaaaaaaach

hrxysfs,2022-01-09 15:12:45,"This is the way it is scored right now: 

>Steelers (10:03) (Shotgun) T.Huntley Aborted. B.Bozeman FUMBLES at BLT 46, RECOVERED by PIT-H.Mondeaux at PIT 39.

Not a sack at the moment"
hrxys42,2022-01-09 15:12:42,ON WISCONSIN!
hrxys32,2022-01-09 15:12:42,This is the best case scenario for Najee.
hrxys1k,2022-01-09 15:12:41,I hope TJ goes off for like 4 more sacks to obliterate the record
hrxyrwc,2022-01-09 15:12:40,"Let’s go TJ. Tied the record guys a straight beast. My favorite Steeler, post Ben for sure."
hrxyrhx,2022-01-09 15:12:36,Would you wear Steelers colors in Baltimore? I wouldn’t.
hrxyrf8,2022-01-09 15:12:35,Reminds me of when I would hear Heath chants two years after he retired
hrxyrey,2022-01-09 15:12:35,Wtf Benny “Emmett smith” Snell

hrxyqkw,2022-01-09 15:12:27,2014 Bell memories. Will be ugly if they win and the jags also win
hrxyqfq,2022-01-09 15:12:25,I think Najee has some nerve damage.
hrxyqad,2022-01-09 15:12:24,Every time  Gentry gets the ball. He looks good.
hrxyq7f,2022-01-09 15:12:23,"Now get another, TJ."
hrxyq6q,2022-01-09 15:12:23,How the fuck would that not be a sack???
hrxynj3,2022-01-09 15:11:55,Watt is a phenom
hrxynin,2022-01-09 15:11:55,Wow they said it might not count
hrxyn9c,2022-01-09 15:11:52,not a sack i dont think. Never was an opportunity to pass
hrxyn6r,2022-01-09 15:11:51,Muth chant for Gentry lol
hrxymws,2022-01-09 15:11:49,That was fast.
hrxymq4,2022-01-09 15:11:47,TJ MOTHER FUCKING WATT
hrxymmf,2022-01-09 15:11:46,Bozeman hit himself square in the taint on that snap
hrxymhx,2022-01-09 15:11:44,"No idea why their QB decided to try to get up with the ball instead of covering it up and staying down, but I'm not complaining"
hrxyme2,2022-01-09 15:11:43,TJ MOTHERFUCKING WATT!!!!!!!
hrxymcp,2022-01-09 15:11:43,TJ is a bad mfer. He shares my bday. He's a Steeler. Why I don't have his jersey idk. I need to fix that.

hrxy7nx,2022-01-09 15:09:13,Backup qb to rookie.... against Steelers defenses
hrxy7e8,2022-01-09 15:09:10,Our QB doesn't have the arm strength.
hrxy6ql,2022-01-09 15:09:03,Maulet is not good in coverage
hrxy3wf,2022-01-09 15:08:34,Would be the least surprising thing to happen unfortunately
hrxy3ll,2022-01-09 15:08:31,We gotta win and jags gotta beat the colts
hrxy2g8,2022-01-09 15:08:20,"""Coach I need to get my steps in. Help a brotha out?""

""Say no more."""
hrxy25v,2022-01-09 15:08:17,Of course Najee has to get hurt in the last game.
hrxy1gl,2022-01-09 15:08:10,Yay another Matt Canada special. Hope Najee's alright.
hrxy1bi,2022-01-09 15:08:09,Way to start. 3 and out and Najee injury
hrxy178,2022-01-09 15:08:07,NAJEE PLEASE SAY SIKE RN I CAN’T HANDLE THIS
hrxy13l,2022-01-09 15:08:07,No way Najee comes back. That arm got destroyed.
hrxy0uv,2022-01-09 15:08:04,Candace has it.
hrxy0pc,2022-01-09 15:08:03,Don't even want playoffs if harris is done

hrxxx50,2022-01-09 15:07:26,They went back to Harvin? That other guy was so good last week.
hrxxx1u,2022-01-09 15:07:26,…..
hrxxwtg,2022-01-09 15:07:23,As someone who as dislocated an elbow that was ugly to see. Hope Najee is ok
hrxxwnm,2022-01-09 15:07:21,That arm looked fucked :(

hrxxvbm,2022-01-09 15:07:07,Broken arm fuck
hrxxv9m,2022-01-09 15:07:07,Welp looks like going with Harvin was the wrong decision.
hrxxv1m,2022-01-09 15:07:05,I dislike every single one of our coaches beside Tomlin. Legitimately all worthless.
hrxxucf,2022-01-09 15:06:57,It’s unreal how bad Harvin is

hrxxr0b,2022-01-09 15:06:22,Too foggy to see where the 1st down sticks are
hrxxqwl,2022-01-09 15:06:21,Oh fuck. That 4 yard pass is not worth a Naj injury
hrxxqki,2022-01-09 15:06:18,what has to happen for the Steelers to make the playoffs?
hrxxphd,2022-01-09 15:06:07,Can someone give link?
hrxxorm,2022-01-09 15:06:00,Baltimore secondary in shambles. Two consecutive runs.
hrxxong,2022-01-09 15:05:59,How is this offense consistently awful to open games lol
hrxxoi2,2022-01-09 15:05:58,"My team isn’t on until 4:30 today. I’ll be watching the Steelers and pulling for Big Ben. Thanks for the memories, 7."
hrxxogl,2022-01-09 15:05:58,"Running against the number 1 run defense. 

Hell yeah."
hrxxnnm,2022-01-09 15:05:49,Run past the marker you fucks
hrxxji4,2022-01-09 15:05:08,I bet it's cause of the double history being made. Tj sack record and Ben's last game
hrxxih3,2022-01-09 15:04:57,Fog. And rain.
hrxxi74,2022-01-09 15:04:55,I hope Ben slings a few passes. Nothing to lose.
hrxxi35,2022-01-09 15:04:53,Anyone else still have fantasy games? I have a chase Ben stack since burrow is out
hrxxhp5,2022-01-09 15:04:50,The Pittsburgh Steelers are my favorite football team.
hrxxhf4,2022-01-09 15:04:47,Is that fog or is there a fire nearby?

hrxxbsz,2022-01-09 15:03:51,"I know nobody expects the Jags to do anything, but it'd be a lot cooler if they did"
hrxxbew,2022-01-09 15:03:47,Is Tucker ill? No touch back great return
hrxxaaw,2022-01-09 15:03:36,Nice return

hrxx0w9,2022-01-09 15:02:01,"As much as I think they're overrated, would've been nice to get the #1 team in Romo and Simms to show respect to Roethlisberger's last game. If this were Drew Brees or someone, they would've made sure they got the #1 team for a network."
hrxwz0f,2022-01-09 15:01:42,Now you're talking!
hrxwyrd,2022-01-09 15:01:40,Very true
hrxwyb6,2022-01-09 15:01:35,**I’m not ready... I’m not ready... I’m not ready... I’m not ready... I’m not ready... I’m not ready... I’m not ready... I’m not ready...**
hrxwxws,2022-01-09 15:01:31,Fingers crossed for a decent FIRST HALF (and second).
hrxwu4m,2022-01-09 15:00:52,Sounds like afc north football.
hrxwt2i,2022-01-09 15:00:41,Let's fkng gooooooo!

hrxwg0b,2022-01-09 14:58:27,Is there an emotional support group for after this game? Asking for a friend….
hrxw461,2022-01-09 14:56:23,"Cold and rainy in Baltimore. 

Sounds absolutely miserable"
hrxw1yw,2022-01-09 14:56:00,Love today's social justice hats today lok
hrxw1ty,2022-01-09 14:55:58,The good thing is we’ll know in the next few hours if we’re making the playoffs or not
hrxvvoh,2022-01-09 14:54:56,Nothing like wrapping up Bens career being serenaded by Ian Eagle!
hrxvnxs,2022-01-09 14:53:39,Lets go Jags!!!
hrxvi8r,2022-01-09 14:52:41,"I feel so bad for him. It must suck to hop around to different teams, finally earn your spot, and then have it ruined by an injury."
hrxvcai,2022-01-09 14:51:40,I can only hope Pittsburgh Dad gets Big Ben on one more time
hrxvbfa,2022-01-09 14:51:30,"I hope we get in but if not, I hope Ben fucks the Ravens one last time!!"
hrxv1mm,2022-01-09 14:49:48,Hell the bungles I would expect them to have Burfutt on the sideline to run out and do it
hrxv0hu,2022-01-09 14:49:37,Waitman has definitely been better but it’s a small sample. I also think losing your spot because of your Dad’s death is just bad. I’m willing to let things ride today and having an open battle in the off season.
hrxuvlt,2022-01-09 14:48:47,This pregame interview with Ben and Caher is making me even more emotional
hrxuush,2022-01-09 14:48:39,And it's ain't gonna be like Favre laying down for Strahan...TJ's gonna earn it
hrxum02,2022-01-09 14:47:07,"I’d expect that behavior from the Bungles, but not Baltimore"
hrxuiq6,2022-01-09 14:46:32,"Sack record will be shattered today. Not tied, but shattered."
hrxui3d,2022-01-09 14:46:26,Banner can’t even get the start? He’s as good as gone
hrxugzc,2022-01-09 14:46:15,Seems like a way to let Harvin prove himself. Open competition I say
hrxuabg,2022-01-09 14:45:08,Think bigger.
hrxt6w2,2022-01-09 14:38:31,"Yes, I for one was excited. To draft a guy  in the first round, and make them sit, Bill cowher always seem to do that."
hrxt0o2,2022-01-09 14:37:26,And it needs to be a 40 oz big Ben can
hrxsvy5,2022-01-09 14:36:39,I don't think anyone on the Ravens is that much of a piece of shit
hrxsn6c,2022-01-09 14:35:06,Maddox couldn't score. Ben came in and scored two TDs although he missed on the 2 pt conversion
hrxsi4k,2022-01-09 14:34:13,This guy......
hrxrxy0,2022-01-09 14:30:43,Everyone have their 7 Iron Citys for Ben's last ride?
hrxqkyj,2022-01-09 14:22:22,Anyone else start drinking already?
hrxq6lp,2022-01-09 14:19:55,You don't know that!
hrxp5bu,2022-01-09 14:13:25,DUUUUUUUVAL
hrxp52j,2022-01-09 14:13:23,alright tj just need them 2 sacks in the first quarter and it will be a great day

hrxow4k,2022-01-09 14:11:49,Like it was yesterday. I am so sad right now
hrxooar,2022-01-09 14:10:27,"Damn, last time we watch Ben suit up 😢"
hrxon02,2022-01-09 14:10:14,Fitting that Ben's first and last game is in Baltimore. Anyone remember him coming in for Tommy Maddox?
hrxnlvi,2022-01-09 14:03:43,7 forever
hrxn5mq,2022-01-09 14:00:52,"I can’t believe I’m saying this, but lfg Jags!"
