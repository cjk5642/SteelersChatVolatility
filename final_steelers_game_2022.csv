hryc146,2022-01-09 16:29:54,Damn couldn't we Madden hail Mary or something...
hryc13h,2022-01-09 16:29:54,"In the words of Bobby ""the Brain"" Heenen 

He got hit in the ol fish and chips"
hryc0i0,2022-01-09 16:29:48,Ok. Offense needs to learn how to score again.
hryc06x,2022-01-09 16:29:45,Someone get TJ the theragun STAT
hryc06q,2022-01-09 16:29:45,The offense should have 17. Matt Canada needs to be sacked at halftime
hrybztd,2022-01-09 16:29:41,Give Claypool the fucking ball
hrybz0n,2022-01-09 16:29:33,Nfl ruled it an aborted play so it didn't count
hrybypx,2022-01-09 16:29:30,Lady at the bar just said that she would rub that out when TJ was grimacing in pain on that pass deflection.. hahahahahahaahahahaha
hrybyld,2022-01-09 16:29:29,I offer my balls as tribute to TJ. I don‚Äôt get any bitches so I don‚Äôt need them
hrybyhh,2022-01-09 16:29:28,We're still in this. That stop was big. I'm pretty sure giving up 7 at this point would be insurmountable.
hrybvch,2022-01-09 16:28:57,Definitely lost a sack
hrybuy2,2022-01-09 16:28:54,Watt tied the sack record but had to sacrifice his sack
hrybum9,2022-01-09 16:28:51,He kneed him in the fucking balls.
hrybucp,2022-01-09 16:28:48,No he didn‚Äôt. Got kneed in the holy place.
hrybucd,2022-01-09 16:28:48,Nope
hrybua0,2022-01-09 16:28:47,Someone get TJ the theragun STAT
hrybu1x,2022-01-09 16:28:45,TJ will get DPOY but I 100% believe he deserves MVP
hrybttr,2022-01-09 16:28:43,Nfl players don‚Äôt wear cups I don‚Äôt think lol
hrybtt8,2022-01-09 16:28:43,Thank god
hrybtn4,2022-01-09 16:28:41,"This is why you wear a cup, no matter what."
hrybtmx,2022-01-09 16:28:41,Just a knee to the nuts. He‚Äôll back out after he collects himself. Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that groin injury he‚Äôs struggled with
hrybtm1,2022-01-09 16:28:41,Doesn't look good. He might've sprained his wrist earlier.
hrybtav,2022-01-09 16:28:38,Keep your head up. Hard work and vitamins. You will get there!
hrybt3n,2022-01-09 16:28:37,Correct
hrybt1g,2022-01-09 16:28:36,Really? didn't see that on the replay
hrybszm,2022-01-09 16:28:36,fire. canada.
hrybsxq,2022-01-09 16:28:35,Hahahahahaha
hrybsrp,2022-01-09 16:28:34,He might have broke the other guys leg with his balls of steel
hrybsk1,2022-01-09 16:28:31,Not any better if it fucks up future Watts from getting it in 20 years later.
hrybsed,2022-01-09 16:28:30,He's hurt
hrybs9t,2022-01-09 16:28:29,Top comment lmao
hrybs7y,2022-01-09 16:28:28,It‚Äôs like how you put your knee up when your dog jumps but it‚Äôs actually the DPOY tj watt
hrybs7e,2022-01-09 16:28:28,Does that mean he loses a sack?
hrybrvx,2022-01-09 16:28:25,He ain‚Äôt even playing right now.
hrybrvh,2022-01-09 16:28:25,That slow mo of the jump üëå
hrybrtl,2022-01-09 16:28:24,Got kneed in the balls
hryborl,2022-01-09 16:27:55,Watt is worth every penny. He's a game changer and picks up the slack for some many other players.
hryboq7,2022-01-09 16:27:55,Harbs go for I cowards! The analytics!
hrybomv,2022-01-09 16:27:54,No way TJ doesn‚Äôt come back to break the record
hrybomu,2022-01-09 16:27:54,hit in the balls
hryboet,2022-01-09 16:27:52,"TJ ties a record for sacks, and then gets his sack tied."
hryboe8,2022-01-09 16:27:51,Huntley nailed him in the nuts with his knee lmao
hryboba,2022-01-09 16:27:51,Right in the twigs and berries
hryboak,2022-01-09 16:27:50,The offense need to get their shit together in the 2nd half. With how the jags are playing this may not be ben‚Äôs last game
hryboa7,2022-01-09 16:27:50,He got kneed in the nuts
hrybo9x,2022-01-09 16:27:50,Not the groin
hrybo9n,2022-01-09 16:27:50,Any chance Najee breaks 98.5 receiving + rush yards?
hrybo9a,2022-01-09 16:27:50,Damn he nutted himself on Huntleys knee
hrybo7q,2022-01-09 16:27:50,Yes
hrybo5n,2022-01-09 16:27:49,"Of course the Jaguars are winning and the best the Steelers can do is 3 points. Story of the season, can never have a complete game."
hrybo4v,2022-01-09 16:27:49,Thought Watt hurt his hand turns out it was his giant ball sack
hrybo1u,2022-01-09 16:27:48,Only way to take tj down is go for the üçÜ
hrybnxx,2022-01-09 16:27:47,That sucks. So he's actually at 24 by my count today if not for some fuckery.
hrybnxj,2022-01-09 16:27:47,"I'm not expecting a Najee quality dude lol, but Snell doesn't belong anywhere but a 3rd/4th string level guy, if he belongs on a 53 at all. Just give me a decent journeyman"
hrybnu5,2022-01-09 16:27:46,"3-3 at the half. It's like a vintage 2000s Steelers-Ravens game, now it just needs a vintage 2000s Steelers-Ravens finish and we're all good."
hrybnsc,2022-01-09 16:27:45,"Goddamn TJ is such a monster. They hold him every play and he still tied the NFL record. If they couldn't hold him, he'd have 30+ sacks this season"
hrybnqy,2022-01-09 16:27:45,Colts are getting outplayed.  But the Jags aren't putting up enough points :/
hrybno2,2022-01-09 16:27:44,took a knee to the manhood
hrybnca,2022-01-09 16:27:41,Happy for TJ. Dude deserves it. Sack record in Pittsburgh is fantastic
hrybnb8,2022-01-09 16:27:41,NOOO! NOT TJ'S COCK
hrybnap,2022-01-09 16:27:41,Knees in the nads

hrybn53,2022-01-09 16:27:39,Oof a knee to the nuts
hrybn27,2022-01-09 16:27:39,"Please tell me Watt just took a shot to the nuts and isn't hurt for the rest of the game.

Yeah Huntley kneed him in the nuts."
hrybmzg,2022-01-09 16:27:38,Oh... oh that hurt my marble sack...

hrybmbu,2022-01-09 16:27:32,TJs massive meat got caught up in the action he'll be fine
hrybm7f,2022-01-09 16:27:30,Damn I don‚Äôt know how to react
hryblzp,2022-01-09 16:27:28,Did Huntley knee him in the balls?
hryblxt,2022-01-09 16:27:28,It looked like Huntley kneed TJ in the nuts. Big fuckin oof.
hryblvn,2022-01-09 16:27:27,Lol bunch guys happy it‚Äôs only a hit to the balls Lolol
hryblru,2022-01-09 16:27:26,he definitely pulled that yikes
hryblro,2022-01-09 16:27:26,It was an aborted play and no longer a pass play. It‚Äôs dumb
hryblql,2022-01-09 16:27:26,"DPOY my ass

hryblp8,2022-01-09 16:27:26,He just took a knee pain to the peepee
hryblp1,2022-01-09 16:27:26,Watt - questionable (Nuts)
hryblol,2022-01-09 16:27:26,TJ literally dicked him down and it hurt the TJ-nuts.
hryblnn,2022-01-09 16:27:25,He tweaked that groin. That may be it for TJ
hryblmc,2022-01-09 16:27:25,Deez nuts
hrybllu,2022-01-09 16:27:25,Ouch town population you bro

hryblka,2022-01-09 16:27:24,Tackling Huntly hard is a penalty but a knee to TJ's nuts is okay.
hryblge,2022-01-09 16:27:23,Fucking Huntley kneeing TJ in the balls
hrybl5y,2022-01-09 16:27:21,One of these two teams is making the playoffs.

hrybhwm,2022-01-09 16:26:49,So TJ should have 2.5 sacks on the day
hrybhw6,2022-01-09 16:26:49,The rules it and aborted play. No sack.
hrybhvm,2022-01-09 16:26:49,Nut shot. Ouchie...

hrybgjb,2022-01-09 16:26:35,Someone said ‚Äúaborted play‚Äù.  Funny that doesn‚Äôt count but Favre nosediving did.
hrybgg7,2022-01-09 16:26:35,"Yeah, I thought he and TJ should have gotten a half each there. They said it was a sack and then penalty."
hrybg64,2022-01-09 16:26:32,LETS GOOOO
hrybg5x,2022-01-09 16:26:32,We could win games w/Huntley
hrybfxa,2022-01-09 16:26:29,I‚Äôd ask if Matt Canada was coaching but there‚Äôs no denying he‚Äôs still coaching here
hrybfwp,2022-01-09 16:26:29,Lol yeah you'd think with the way people were talking in here that he broke the record.
hrybfqs,2022-01-09 16:26:27,Refs gonna be looking for every reason to give this to the ratbirds in the second half.
hrybflv,2022-01-09 16:26:26,Oh no his groin!
hrybfis,2022-01-09 16:26:25,I cannot believe how fucking bad Harvin is‚Ä¶

hrybfcq,2022-01-09 16:26:23,No TJ no
hrybfan,2022-01-09 16:26:23,Man he is a beast
hrybf8q,2022-01-09 16:26:22,"Nobody know, they called it an aborted play"
hrybf7o,2022-01-09 16:26:22,Shit TJ groin
hrybf2q,2022-01-09 16:26:20,"I don‚Äôt know but TJ has basically only played 14 games even if he‚Äôs started in 16
EDIT: I believe strahan played in 17 games"
hrybc6w,2022-01-09 16:25:52,Don‚Äôt know who it was but O-lineman there had TJ in a full on headlock‚Ä¶
hrybbyn,2022-01-09 16:25:50,Yes.
hrybbvo,2022-01-09 16:25:49,Should‚Äôve been to take the record. Whatever he‚Äôll just get it here
hrybbru,2022-01-09 16:25:48,"Wattttttt!!!!!!!!!!! He‚Äôs got it, now let‚Äôs go definitively get the record. Also why do I feel if he gets one more sack, that the earlier sack take n away will be credited. But if he didn‚Äôt they wouldn‚Äôt credit him idk. High off watt right now lol."
hrybbk5,2022-01-09 16:25:46,One more to go for the record. And Watt has done it all in 14 games.
hrybbgo,2022-01-09 16:25:45,Penalty erases it
hrybbfy,2022-01-09 16:25:44,Cash checks
hrybbd0,2022-01-09 16:25:43,Dpoy on LOCK
hrybb6h,2022-01-09 16:25:42,Jax has been at the goal line a couple times now and settled for field goals.
hrybb6a,2022-01-09 16:25:42,I love Cam but he knows you can't hit that high
hrybb1b,2022-01-09 16:25:40,16. TJ did it in 13.5.
hrybat9,2022-01-09 16:25:38,Wattage
hrybaq8,2022-01-09 16:25:37,So to and cam dont get the sack cause of roughness?
hrybalj,2022-01-09 16:25:36,"More like Bollywood Brown, amirite? 

(No offense to the Indian film industry intended.)"
hrybakg,2022-01-09 16:25:36,"So wait, he‚Äôs tied??"
hrybajw,2022-01-09 16:25:35,"Yeah, I don't get it..."
hrybajq,2022-01-09 16:25:35,Seems unlikely
hrybahf,2022-01-09 16:25:35,WATTTTTTTTT
hrybaaq,2022-01-09 16:25:33,TJ hasn't played in 16 games of that's what you're going for
hryba2h,2022-01-09 16:25:31,I think they go for it if we don't stop them here.

hryb90w,2022-01-09 16:25:20,Go Jags!
hryb8jh,2022-01-09 16:25:15,"So the problem with the ""hurr durr let me watch Ben one more time, if you disagree you're not a real fan"" crowd is, There is nothing to be gained by watching Ben and the Steelers lose a playoff game. Ben has been great and has had every opportunity to go out on his shield. However, he and this team, just doesn't have it anymore, at least not this season for sure. So, for me, it's either superbowl or bust, that doesn't mean I don't root for us to win that's just how I measure the success of this team. So, trot Ben out for one more primetime embarrassment? or better draft position and look forward to the unknown, exciting aspects of a new era in Steeler football. It's time for whatever's next, and with that, a few spots in the middle of the draft make a HUGE difference as far as the type of player you can get. When you even suggest the idea of such a thing, it gets met with mind-numbing levels of homer-isms and gatekeeping. There is no reasonable argument to be made that isn't basely purely on selfishness."
hryb8hi,2022-01-09 16:25:15,DPOY!!

hryb586,2022-01-09 16:24:44,Watt should be 1.5 sacks above the prior record right now.
hryb55l,2022-01-09 16:24:43,Bullshit. I hate all these rules that make it easy on the QB and impossible on the defense

hryb4n5,2022-01-09 16:24:38,"Shouldn't he get a half sack on the Heyward sack?

Or does the penalty negate the sack?"
hryb4n1,2022-01-09 16:24:38,That's what you fucking get Huntley. Hope it keeps happening for the rest of your day.
hryb4mb,2022-01-09 16:24:38,Glad we paid watt
hryb4kw,2022-01-09 16:24:38,"helmet on helmet, they're gonna call that every time."
hryb4ha,2022-01-09 16:24:37,I think TJ just got the record. I believe the NFL will change the first one after the game.

hryb3lt,2022-01-09 16:24:28,Did watt give a half sack on the previous play with Heyward?
hryb3dr,2022-01-09 16:24:26,Fuck these announcers and if a QB wants to play the game like a running back they should be able to get hit like one.

We‚Äôve played essentially everyone who may face in the wild card and have looked like complete shit. I think we win if Canada stops calling plays, Najee is 100%, and Big Ben figures out how to complete a ball 5 yards down field."
hryb2ua,2022-01-09 16:24:21,Sorry that's not a sack. That's a run play for loss. Huntley was clearly the runner.

hryas6u,2022-01-09 16:22:39,I was gonna ask am I just biased or are they being held like crazy. The other comments gave me the answer. This is ridiculous
hryas39,2022-01-09 16:22:38,Only the first half
hryas2q,2022-01-09 16:22:38,Arm belt on Watt
hryas2b,2022-01-09 16:22:37,run a ref

hryarnw,2022-01-09 16:22:34,WHAT?!
hryarnv,2022-01-09 16:22:34,Why the celebration
hryare5,2022-01-09 16:22:31,Bitch made refs calling a penalty because he was hit hard.
hryar9f,2022-01-09 16:22:30,So obvious on that last play
hryar4o,2022-01-09 16:22:29,The other punter is out with covid
hryar19,2022-01-09 16:22:28,Are you fucking serious
hryaqs7,2022-01-09 16:22:25,"How was there no hold against Watt?  A ref should have eyes on him all game, we KNOW he's gonna get held"
hryaqkv,2022-01-09 16:22:23,TJ!
hryaqe8,2022-01-09 16:22:21,Hold on Watt not called again
hryaqak,2022-01-09 16:22:20,How about that hold on Watt?
hryaq7e,2022-01-09 16:22:20,We are not playing well but at worst it‚Äôs 8-3 going into the half.
hryaq47,2022-01-09 16:22:19,"The offense is vomit inducing, but it's pretty funny that the only reason the Ravens are threatening to score is because for some reason Tomlin and co. decided to allow Harvin to punt this game despite everyone with eyes thinking he lost the job."
hryaq2w,2022-01-09 16:22:18,"Um no our incompetent offense will, of the offense continues the game won't even be close because they won't won't sniff field goal range again"
hryaq1v,2022-01-09 16:22:18,Gonna lose and tj not getting the record. book it
hryaq1j,2022-01-09 16:22:18,"Ask someone out the stand then, there is no way they would be worse than that fat bastard."
hryaq01,2022-01-09 16:22:17,He burst through both guys and they just grab him. These pussy refs won‚Äôt call a damn thing
hryapya,2022-01-09 16:22:17,Nice hold on watt btw
hryappn,2022-01-09 16:22:15,That's a half TJ sack
hryapbs,2022-01-09 16:22:11,Even if we do make the playoffs we‚Äôre gonna get murdered lol
hryap8l,2022-01-09 16:22:10,HOLDING ON TJ WTFFFF
hryaoz6,2022-01-09 16:22:08,Our defense can only do so much
hryaoxi,2022-01-09 16:22:07,Two tackles on TJ both holding him lmao
hryaol4,2022-01-09 16:22:04,>Tomlin should be fired
hryaok1,2022-01-09 16:22:04,The game isn‚Äôt over
hryal5d,2022-01-09 16:21:31,Clothesline TJ no call
hryakoj,2022-01-09 16:21:26,"I mean, the offense coulda gained some yards."
hryakah,2022-01-09 16:21:22,They hold TJ every fuckin time
hryak2o,2022-01-09 16:21:20,"Dude, put the weed down."
hryak0b,2022-01-09 16:21:19,Leave it to the Steelers to lose when the teams controlling their destiny actually give them the results they need.
hryajrq,2022-01-09 16:21:17,Highsmith loses contain all the time.
hryajpl,2022-01-09 16:21:16,Yikes I don‚Äôt want to see this offense try to play from behind. But whatever fuck it‚Ä¶
hryajp2,2022-01-09 16:21:16,If dumb yinzers had their way we would have thrown Boswell aside too... I'm willing to wait until next season.
hryajoe,2022-01-09 16:21:16,Tomlin should be fired for putting that fat cunt Harvin back in.
hryajkd,2022-01-09 16:21:15,I honestly don't even know if I want them to get in... watching them all season you know they're going to get pummeled in the wild card.
hryaja1,2022-01-09 16:21:12,"I think there‚Äôs a strong argument to be made there. Genuinely, his piss-poor punting has lost us so much field position‚Ä¶ could see us winning one, MAYBE two more games were it not for a handful of particularly poor punts."
hryaj97,2022-01-09 16:21:11,This organization has been making some seriously questionable decisions lately
hryaiwg,2022-01-09 16:21:08,Holy fuck‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm keeping last weeks memory a nice one and turning this game off.
hryaifs,2022-01-09 16:21:03,Harvin costing us the lead jjst like the Titans game
hryai8p,2022-01-09 16:21:02,"Can‚Äôt even blame the defense, they‚Äôre clearly gassed. If this offense could do anything and if Harvin could punt it more than 2 yards then maybe the D gets a real chance"
hryai1u,2022-01-09 16:21:00,Why are they letting him run?
hryahum,2022-01-09 16:20:58,"Jags first down at the 2


8 seconds left"
hryahf7,2022-01-09 16:20:53,If the Ravens win and the Jags win then I will officially give up football until next season. Disgusting.
hryaf4z,2022-01-09 16:20:31,Matt Canada: Pathetically predictable and predictably pathetic
hryaf4a,2022-01-09 16:20:30,Tomlin is calling timeouts like we're not just going to call a draw or short screen pass
hryaf13,2022-01-09 16:20:30,We would play KC
hryaewd,2022-01-09 16:20:28,We‚Äôve literally seen ben punt farther before
hryaeq2,2022-01-09 16:20:26,Yeah called it before the game. Jacksonville will actually pull out a win and we'll figure out how to lose.
hryae7b,2022-01-09 16:20:21,Pull Harvin
hryae4d,2022-01-09 16:20:20,Not letting waitman punt was a big mistake
hryady4,2022-01-09 16:20:19,Well this is the turning point.
hryadtw,2022-01-09 16:20:17,I don‚Äôt support Tonkin but Waitman has COVID
hryadot,2022-01-09 16:20:16,"Jesus, this is embarrassing."
hryado0,2022-01-09 16:20:16,We need a pick 6
hryadnl,2022-01-09 16:20:15,Lol no clue why Harvin got a helmet over Waitman today
hryadku,2022-01-09 16:20:15,Just let Ben air it out on 4th down for an interception. He‚Äôd get more yards.
hryaddb,2022-01-09 16:20:13,I feel like the entire coaching staff is fucking with us
hryad0e,2022-01-09 16:20:09,somebody has to die
hryacv5,2022-01-09 16:20:08,Need a turnover!!!
hryact6,2022-01-09 16:20:07,Bodymore gets the ball back in second half too.
hryaco6,2022-01-09 16:20:06,Prob cause his Dad died and they got sentimental instead of making the business decision
hryacj6,2022-01-09 16:20:05,Pity isn't a valid reason to roster a professional football player.
hryacdv,2022-01-09 16:20:03,Huntley throwing like Favre out there while Ben lobbing ints
hryac9l,2022-01-09 16:20:02,Why are we still starting Harvin?
hryac59,2022-01-09 16:20:01,Fucking baffling. With the playoffs on the line.
hryac0y,2022-01-09 16:19:59,Thanks Harvin now Ravens will score
hryabwm,2022-01-09 16:19:58,HOLDING ON WORMLEY ARE THE REFS BLIND
hryabw3,2022-01-09 16:19:58,"Steelers in the playoffs would be tough to watch. If we give Cincy their first playoff win in 30 hears, I'll be majorly bummed."
hryabv7,2022-01-09 16:19:58,Yes.
hryabub,2022-01-09 16:19:58,Why is Mark Andrews open on every play?
hryabpa,2022-01-09 16:19:56,Jesus Christ
hryabl4,2022-01-09 16:19:55,Nice push off Andrews
hryabk8,2022-01-09 16:19:55,Tomlin with another game losing decision by playing Harvin
hryabjf,2022-01-09 16:19:55,"Ahhhhh wanted harvin to be good, and hopefully he pans out. But the other punter is way better!!!"
hryabd2,2022-01-09 16:19:53,I feel we‚Äôve lost games this year because of Harvin.
hryabcy,2022-01-09 16:19:53,Need a new punter next year Harvin ain't it
hryabbt,2022-01-09 16:19:52,What happened to the punter we had last week‚Ä¶ we need him
hrya8tf,2022-01-09 16:19:28,Please cut Harvin.
hrya8nf,2022-01-09 16:19:27,"my gripe with this coaching staff again, the decision making. you have a punter who played well for 2 weeks. and a punter that lost his father and has not played well. somehow you play the bad punter in the last game of the year. so, why are we not rewarding good play? im flabbergasted"
hrya8lt,2022-01-09 16:19:26,This hurts to watch.
hrya8e9,2022-01-09 16:19:24,Our play calling better improve in the second half. We need to at least get a first down
hrya8bv,2022-01-09 16:19:23,Wow... Okay well. Harvin needs to compete for the spot this off-season for sure
hrya8bd,2022-01-09 16:19:23,Fuck Harvin
hrya877,2022-01-09 16:19:22,Bro fuck Harvin lmao
hrya86l,2022-01-09 16:19:22,Waitman is miles better than Harvin

hrya7x0,2022-01-09 16:19:19,WHWRE IS THE FUCKING FLAGS FOR HOLDING
hrya7wa,2022-01-09 16:19:19,"Wound up in trouble because of a good punt by BAL, followed by a typical dogshit punt from fatty."
hrya7vi,2022-01-09 16:19:18,Why is Harvin back in?
hrya7rn,2022-01-09 16:19:17,"I get we feel bad for harvin, but hes shit. Get him out of here"
hrya7qz,2022-01-09 16:19:17,‚ÄúNot a great punt there by Harvin‚Äù
hrya7pn,2022-01-09 16:19:17,Solid 30 yard punt lmfao
hrya7nv,2022-01-09 16:19:16,TJ we need a sack!
hrya7nn,2022-01-09 16:19:16,Ben repeatedly throwing balls that I can even discern who the target is but people here want to throw it more? Lmao
hrya7m7,2022-01-09 16:19:16,Fuck. Let TJ punt
hrya7jf,2022-01-09 16:19:15,Starting to worry more about Beating the Ravens than the Jags beating the Colts
hrya7gm,2022-01-09 16:19:14,"What's it going to take to bench Harvin, seriously"
hrya7g7,2022-01-09 16:19:14,"Smfh I called it, unfortunately lmao. This team is so predictable. 3 and out, Harvin shanked punt, ravens score before the half ‚Ä¶. Unbelievable"
hrya7e8,2022-01-09 16:19:14,Everyone looks horrible today. Can't say anyone is having a good game.
hrya7ap,2022-01-09 16:19:13,Harvin is not good enough unfortunately
hrya771,2022-01-09 16:19:11,He‚Äôs too fat he can‚Äôt pick his leg up
hrya76c,2022-01-09 16:19:11,You can‚Äôt suck punting from your own end. Goddamnit.
hrya70l,2022-01-09 16:19:10,"Happy Birthday,  Princess Tommy!"
hrya6zh,2022-01-09 16:19:09,Harvin needs to join Buggs.

hrya633,2022-01-09 16:19:01,That was the worst 3 and out of the season. Fuck
hrya622,2022-01-09 16:19:00,There was no reason to bench Waitman today
hrya5v2,2022-01-09 16:18:58,How the fuck is Harvin still our punter how fucking stupid are our coaches
hrya5qp,2022-01-09 16:18:57,Harvin is done

hrya5ib,2022-01-09 16:18:55,Holy fucking shit we are bad. Next season is gonna be brutal if we're currently playing our best option at QB
hrya5hi,2022-01-09 16:18:55,"Lmao Heyward throwing his hands up. This game is 100% a loss if Ben continues this, no way they have the balls to put Rudolph in to give us a chance"
hrya5ge,2022-01-09 16:18:55,Ugly punt
hrya5a8,2022-01-09 16:18:53,Eight seconds of offense that was
hrya595,2022-01-09 16:18:53,Their punter is booting it & pinning us deep while Harvin hasn't had one good punt so far.
hrya57s,2022-01-09 16:18:52,Get the skinny punter in. Thicc punter out

hrya15m,2022-01-09 16:18:13,well thank God this will be the last time we see this specific putrid offense. lol
hrya146,2022-01-09 16:18:13,Can't believe they drafted this punter.

hrya0v4,2022-01-09 16:18:10,Why do I get the feeling that the jags are gonna win and we‚Äôre gonna lose
hrya0s1,2022-01-09 16:18:09,With each punt I want the replacement punter back.

hrya0n7,2022-01-09 16:18:08,bro wtf is this play calling
hrya0m5,2022-01-09 16:18:08,"I assume you‚Äôve watched a lot of Steeler games versus you guys over the years‚Ä¶by now you should know if we are playing away we are playing ultra conservative unless forced out of that by the score.  If you guys can‚Äôt put up points offensively the Steelers will be content to run for 1 yard gains and punt the ball and hope to win by a FG or late drive.  That‚Äôs what we do.

It‚Äôs not fun to watch as a fan but they‚Äôve been pretty successful with that model - and I think you guys are probably pretty similar too which is why the score is 3-0."
hrya0bb,2022-01-09 16:18:04,Ben looks fucking horrible

hry9uxi,2022-01-09 16:17:12,"Thank fuck, this has been awful. We desperately need a good RB2 next year."
hry9uiv,2022-01-09 16:17:08,"look at it this way, even when we lose, snell, colbert, ben, edmunds, chuks, canada, ebron etc will all be gone."
hry9uei,2022-01-09 16:17:07,He‚Äôs mad after Cinci went for that passing record

hry9tbf,2022-01-09 16:16:56,Jesus this looks terrible
hry9t66,2022-01-09 16:16:54,Full on double team every snap and going away from him on roll outs. Ultimate sign of respect. Still pisses me off
hry9swm,2022-01-09 16:16:52,Oh man those throwbacks were my favorites
hry9srb,2022-01-09 16:16:50,This game is a fitting end to the post Killer Bs era.
hry9sks,2022-01-09 16:16:48,Oh I know. Smart thing to do as a coach hoping to win. Still tho. Fuck you guy

hry9sfn,2022-01-09 16:16:47,If only Claypool would lose it like AB and quit and run off the field and jump into the locker room
hry9s3s,2022-01-09 16:16:44,"Canada saving his worst game for the last, I see. A high school coach could literally understand that you don't attack a team's ONE strength when it's additionally one of your BIGGEST weaknesses."
hry9rva,2022-01-09 16:16:41,"You just know Harbaugh wants to wreck TJ's chances whereas Favre gave up the record sack. Really, TJ already tied it if you take away the sack Favre gave up on purpose.  Doesn't work like that though..obviously."
hry9r7c,2022-01-09 16:16:34,"Rodgers, Wilson, Jimmy G, or Carr for next years QB?"
hry9ood,2022-01-09 16:16:09,That's also the gameplan to win the game tbh
hry9odx,2022-01-09 16:16:07,The jags are doing this and we‚Äôre fucking it up
hry9o4q,2022-01-09 16:16:04,At this point I think he'd like to hear his reasoning and philosophy too!

Why can‚Äôt we be aggressive downfield 

No check downs, if you need to get rid of the ball throw it out"
hry9mpo,2022-01-09 16:15:50,He‚Äôs coming back. It was just announced.
hry9mhc,2022-01-09 16:15:48,Because our OC is a moron.
hry9mfm,2022-01-09 16:15:48,because our Oc is a clown
hry9lie,2022-01-09 16:15:39,Have you not been watching? That is Ben trying to sling it.
hry9krk,2022-01-09 16:15:32,Coaches can‚Äôt coach
hry9h1s,2022-01-09 16:14:55,"Fourth quarter Ben, best Ben!"
hry9h0n,2022-01-09 16:14:54,"So‚Ä¶ worst oline in the league, vs the best run defense in the league‚Ä¶ wonder why we are unsuccessfully running the ball today?"
hry9gwn,2022-01-09 16:14:53,Let Ben call the plays fuck Canada
hry9gpu,2022-01-09 16:14:52,At this point I‚Äôm ready for Ben to retire and just take Canadas job.
hry9gko,2022-01-09 16:14:50,"One offense has the starting QB, and the other does not. It shouldn't be close."
hry9gfo,2022-01-09 16:14:49,Benny Snell would be really good if you had 10 plays to get a first down rather than 4. His conversion rate would be at least 50%
hry9fqv,2022-01-09 16:14:42,Yea lets run with baladge dahn the middle against the best run defense lmao
hry9ffn,2022-01-09 16:14:39,Honestly bring back Connor on a cheap 2 year deal next year to be our Backup RB.
hry9fc9,2022-01-09 16:14:38,Terrible clock management by Harbaugh
hry9f8l,2022-01-09 16:14:37,Claypool doing dumb shit again
hry9f8h,2022-01-09 16:14:37,I just want Matt Canada to do an open Q&A. I'd do ANYTHING to hear him explain his reasoning and philosophy.
hry9f6d,2022-01-09 16:14:36,Pathetic play calling. Honestly think they just wanna get this over with
hry9f4g,2022-01-09 16:14:36,1st and 10 feels like 1st and 25th.
hry9eog,2022-01-09 16:14:32,Matt Canada
hry9enw,2022-01-09 16:14:31,This game is 100% proof that neither of these teams deserve a playoff spot.

hry9dvd,2022-01-09 16:14:23,Stop fucking running bozo
hry9dq1,2022-01-09 16:14:22,"So TJ still needs a sack to tie the record, right?  Hopefully they told him that earlier one didn't count."
hry9dkq,2022-01-09 16:14:20,Let's try Claynuts?
hry9de8,2022-01-09 16:14:18,The complex tapestry known as the steelers.
hry9de1,2022-01-09 16:14:18,Please just don‚Äôt fuck up terribly here and get to half
hry9dd0,2022-01-09 16:14:18,They can‚Äôt be serious
hry9ars,2022-01-09 16:13:53,I love how no matter who plays qb for the ravens they just pretend like the wide receiver position doesn‚Äôt exist
hry9aob,2022-01-09 16:13:52,Cant wait to see two 1 yard runs back to back and then either a bomb into three defenders or a 3 yard out route
hry9amb,2022-01-09 16:13:51,Ravens are one of the best rush defenses and one of the worst pass defenses and they run run pass every 3 and out
hry9alj,2022-01-09 16:13:51,Claypool has done nothing but is involved in the extracurricular stuff. Play football you fucking clown!
hry9ah9,2022-01-09 16:13:50,As all teams should lol
hry9acu,2022-01-09 16:13:48,Watched Arsenal and this at the same time. Two dogshit games
hry9a77,2022-01-09 16:13:47,well at this point im not sure whose offense is worse
hry9a3w,2022-01-09 16:13:46,You wouldn‚Äôt?
hry99g7,2022-01-09 16:13:40,What happened to Najee?
hry994s,2022-01-09 16:13:37,Another run for no gain. You love to see it :(
hry993g,2022-01-09 16:13:36,They‚Äôre consistently double and triple teaming tj to not get the record.
hry98zr,2022-01-09 16:13:35,Let üëè Ben üëè Ball üëè Out
hry98qf,2022-01-09 16:13:33,I'm fucking pissed about it üòÇ you can't split hairs finer than they did earlier.
hry98kb,2022-01-09 16:13:31,Who the fuck runs a stretch play with a 3rd string running back on their own 5?
hry98jd,2022-01-09 16:13:31,WHY. WHY.
hry98eq,2022-01-09 16:13:30,"Figured lol, didn't know if you were referring to 2008 Steeler Ravens games"
hry982i,2022-01-09 16:13:27,"When one of our players slips on a route and a good throw misses its target: Fuck.

When one of the Ravens players slips on a route and a good throw misses its target: Thank fuck."
hry981q,2022-01-09 16:13:27,The punter bowl
hry97xx,2022-01-09 16:13:26,TJ Watt. -3.5 sacks
hry97pk,2022-01-09 16:13:23,"they are double, sometimes triple blocking him.
Look at the formations and how many bodies they put against Watt's side"
hry97lc,2022-01-09 16:13:22,They may have to Move watt around on 3rd and long.
hry97eq,2022-01-09 16:13:20,A lot going on in your comment!
hry94ee,2022-01-09 16:12:51,"I am hoping the Jags colts game is close, just in case I have to start to root for Indy to keep the Ravens out of the playoffs."
hry94d6,2022-01-09 16:12:51,Both teams are so bad man
hry94a0,2022-01-09 16:12:50,Andrews wondering why there wasn‚Äôt a flag on that one too.
hry93qo,2022-01-09 16:12:45,Bunch of PUSSIES. Double team two tackles on TJ
hry93ld,2022-01-09 16:12:43,IT FITS HE IS BENJAMIN BUTTON!!!
hry93dn,2022-01-09 16:12:41,TJ getting double teamed literally every play. He will still get the sack record tho
hry92wc,2022-01-09 16:12:36,Thank god
hry92n6,2022-01-09 16:12:34,Canada is terrible. Ben is struggling. Najee on the bench. Johnson got banged up. Juju dancing on the bench as always. LET'S GO DEFENSE!
hry912x,2022-01-09 16:12:18,TJ running out of time
hry90yg,2022-01-09 16:12:17,Is Haskins active?   Really wanted to see him play this season.   Christ he was a 1st rounder 3 years ago.   Any news about him getting any better??
hry90x2,2022-01-09 16:12:17,They would‚Äôve called it a run if he was
hry90vq,2022-01-09 16:12:16,What a shit field. Everyone's on ice out there.
hry8xdm,2022-01-09 16:11:42,"Ahha, that is stupid. I can see if the QB just falls on the ball and you touch him down, but if they stand back up and have the time/opportunity to throw the ball, it should be a sack."
hry8xa7,2022-01-09 16:11:41,Huntley sooo happy he didn't fumble there lmao
hry8x2r,2022-01-09 16:11:39,Whenever Huntley gives up an easy sack TJ isn't in.
hry8wy7,2022-01-09 16:11:38,Why not let TJ have it?
hry8wx5,2022-01-09 16:11:37,"Positive affirmation

Everything is calm"
hry8vyl,2022-01-09 16:11:28,"Damn, why couldn't TJ be on the field for that"
hry8vg2,2022-01-09 16:11:23,You're loving this first half? This game is a loss if it continues  like this on offense.
hry8vfz,2022-01-09 16:11:23,"Fuck you, homer"
hry8vb0,2022-01-09 16:11:22,I 100% blame the coaching staff for not being able to get this team going until the 4th quarter. How do you manage to look like this EVERY game and make no adjustments?
hry8utx,2022-01-09 16:11:17,"What are the FA corners next year because 

1.	We need to draft oline man
2.	we suck at drafting corners"
hry8udn,2022-01-09 16:11:13,Fully prepared for this outcome
hry8u6d,2022-01-09 16:11:11,Strahan sack opportunity there
hry8u48,2022-01-09 16:11:10,Both teams are out
hry8u3g,2022-01-09 16:11:10,Andrew‚Äôs is literally he only playmaker they have left come on
hry8tqm,2022-01-09 16:11:07,I really dislike Andrews.
hry8tov,2022-01-09 16:11:06,If we win this and Jax wins we HAVE to get Najee back. Our offense is nothing without him
hry8qnj,2022-01-09 16:10:37,Prediction: JAX beats the Colts and we don‚Äôt take care of business today.
hry8qd0,2022-01-09 16:10:34,I‚Äôm just telling myself we‚Äôll come alive In the second half
hry8pxz,2022-01-09 16:10:30,"Would love to see Tomlin pull Ben and see what Mason can do. Nothing to lose really, and if you make the playoffs it's like playing with house money."
hry8pvy,2022-01-09 16:10:29,I'd prefer we do runs which don't rely on a poor offensive line to open holes for a subpar runner and then continuing to do those same plays with little to no results ending in another kick on 4th and long.
hry8pmq,2022-01-09 16:10:27,I think ben has already mentally retired
hry8pgt,2022-01-09 16:10:25,Idk what wrong with everyone on here. Bens just trying to give TJ more opportunities to get this record.
hry8p7i,2022-01-09 16:10:23,Jesus fucking christ
hry8owz,2022-01-09 16:10:20,Can we just throw slants please
hry8omm,2022-01-09 16:10:17,Ben is having a terrible final game
hry8old,2022-01-09 16:10:17,WHY THE FUCK IS MAULET PLAYING????
hry8oi0,2022-01-09 16:10:16,man we can‚Äôt guard mark andrews
hry8ohi,2022-01-09 16:10:16,This is painful‚Ä¶but it wouldn‚Äôt shock me if a different guy showed up in the second half.
hry8oca,2022-01-09 16:10:14,I liked Maulet better on the sideline
hry8o9s,2022-01-09 16:10:14,Did the Steelers forget that they‚Äôre playing for a chance in the playoffs?
hry8o7w,2022-01-09 16:10:13,Brain damage making him see ghosts
hry8o7j,2022-01-09 16:10:13,Trademark Steelers first half. Loving it
hry8o1z,2022-01-09 16:10:12,You gotta run sometimes
hry8nuf,2022-01-09 16:10:10,Andrew‚Äôs is the whole Ravens offense
hry8ngz,2022-01-09 16:10:06,50 yard kick after he got a lucky bounce. Whoever sat Waitman should be fired. Its such a simple decision that is handled so fucking horribly
hry8ngu,2022-01-09 16:10:06,Two*
hry8ngt,2022-01-09 16:10:06,Snell football was a gimmick to get this dude drafted I swear.
hry8kcg,2022-01-09 16:09:36,You spelled McCloud wrong
hry8k8k,2022-01-09 16:09:35,Can Benny snell not see? I‚Äôve never seen a rb miss so many blatantly obvious holes my god
hry8k4r,2022-01-09 16:09:34,This bad punting is gonna bite us in the ass in a field position dominated game
hry8k1r,2022-01-09 16:09:34,It‚Äôs heavily Snell
hry8jvz,2022-01-09 16:09:32,Our offense looks like straight dick
hry8jqg,2022-01-09 16:09:31,Dude is seeing ghosts or something
hry8jd2,2022-01-09 16:09:27,I mean... it's your choice.  I'm just saying Huch Jr. has YEARS of screwing the Steelers to catch up with daddy... but you do you :)
hry8jcc,2022-01-09 16:09:27,Well a deep shot on 3rd and 8 is better than a deep shot on 3rd and 2 I guess...
hry8jb6,2022-01-09 16:09:26,I can‚Äôt be the only one wondering who  that pass was for.
hry8j8q,2022-01-09 16:09:26,Finally a good punt
hry8j5j,2022-01-09 16:09:25,Probably a receiver who ran the wrong route
hry8iqo,2022-01-09 16:09:21,"Ben looked at the Jags score, and was like nah I'm ready to retire"
hry8ijr,2022-01-09 16:09:19,Nice of our offense to keep stalling too give tj a chance at the record
hry8ibc,2022-01-09 16:09:17,"Yeah duh, Canada did that"
hry8i80,2022-01-09 16:09:16,Why is harvin punting? Waitman was better than harvin has been at any point in the season
hry8i5o,2022-01-09 16:09:15,"My second ‚ÄúBig Ben gotta go‚Äù post, but yeah‚Ä¶you gotta go, big guy. Thanks for the memories."
hry8hv9,2022-01-09 16:09:13,I don't wanna see snell ever again
hry8huc,2022-01-09 16:09:12,So we're legit playing not to win
hry8hma,2022-01-09 16:09:10,Who was that too?
hry8hlg,2022-01-09 16:09:10,Lol. The jags are gonna win and we‚Äôre gonna lose and the ravens are gonna end up in the playoffs
hry8hi5,2022-01-09 16:09:09,Can we win 3-0? I hope so.

hry8do0,2022-01-09 16:08:33,Indy 4th & 12
hry8dnx,2022-01-09 16:08:33,Absolutely awful offense. Can‚Äôt stand this shit. It‚Äôs just 3 and outs over and over again.
hry8ctw,2022-01-09 16:08:25,Snell EXPLODING for two.
hry8ctc,2022-01-09 16:08:25,Boy our offense ain‚Äôt very good

hry8c6e,2022-01-09 16:08:18,"2nd and 10... running play for Snell right up the middle.

Why?"
hry8c6d,2022-01-09 16:08:18,Who's ben thrown to ghosts
hry8c40,2022-01-09 16:08:18,Lol this an old school game
hry8c3u,2022-01-09 16:08:18,Cmon Ben who you throwing to?
hry8c28,2022-01-09 16:08:17,These running plays are terrible and it‚Äôs not snell
hry8bt4,2022-01-09 16:08:15,Ben is literally throwing to nobody this game
hry8br4,2022-01-09 16:08:14,What are these fucking plays
hry8bkw,2022-01-09 16:08:12,I had the same thought earlier üòÇ
hry8bey,2022-01-09 16:08:11,"I wouldn't blame Harbaughs game plan. If it works and they score and win, nicely done. If it doesn't he'll have to change up, or lose stupidly, and he won't do that. Up to the offense to get points and force Huntley to face Watt"
hry8av3,2022-01-09 16:08:05,"2 yard throw, run. If Canada is the OC next year we could have Aaron Rodgers at QB and we‚Äôd be lucky to go 8-8-1"
hry8atp,2022-01-09 16:08:05,"Chase needs targets. It‚Äôs as simple as that, hope the next oc gets him more involved as he should."
hry8ag5,2022-01-09 16:08:01,Thanks for info. Hope it means it‚Äôs not a serious injury if he‚Äôs probable
hry8a70,2022-01-09 16:07:59,You give too much credit to our offense
hry8a6n,2022-01-09 16:07:59,This offense lol
hry8a2z,2022-01-09 16:07:58,We might have to win this game 3-0 or hope for defensive points.
hry8a08,2022-01-09 16:07:57,Ben‚Äôs process is just so slow. Gentry was wide open for a 5 yard gain on first down.
hry89zm,2022-01-09 16:07:57,"We're honestly,  objectively terrible."
hry89yj,2022-01-09 16:07:57,How badly does Matt Canada hate 2nd down passing plays
hry89wk,2022-01-09 16:07:56,Ben looks so indecisive today... not good
hry873t,2022-01-09 16:07:30,FUCK MATT CANADA. JESUS WTF IS HE DOING.
hry85rv,2022-01-09 16:07:17,Claypool was wide open
hry85ls,2022-01-09 16:07:16,Wish the Steelers would utilize play action in even a minor capacity.
hry8559,2022-01-09 16:07:12,Q2: 2:00 - Jaguars 10 - Colts 3
hry84qy,2022-01-09 16:07:08,Plays like that is what happens when you have Ben sit there and hold the ball to throw intermediate routes all game
hry80h0,2022-01-09 16:06:28,i was wondering what the problem was
hry809d,2022-01-09 16:06:26,"""FUCK THROWING, WE WILL RUN THE BALL DOWN THEIR GODDAMN THROATS UNTIL THEY LOVE US."" - Matt Canada, probably."
hry807y,2022-01-09 16:06:25,"Stadium gets SO LOUD when Watt gets close. Steelers fans wanting him to get the record, Ravens fans wanting him not to."
hry7zxn,2022-01-09 16:06:23,a terrible ruling that even though its a pass play and the quarterback is tackled in the backfield somehow a bad snap negates that
hry7zqj,2022-01-09 16:06:21,I bet Canada has some shit plays designed
hry7z53,2022-01-09 16:06:15,Micah parsons deserves it more than donald
hry7z33,2022-01-09 16:06:15,"Absolutely, the offense is so unbelievably bad"
hry7z2w,2022-01-09 16:06:15,Alright let‚Äôs get them off balance boys. Start off with the ray ray screen on first down follow it up with runs up the middle on 2nd and 3rd down
hry7yuw,2022-01-09 16:06:13,Aaron Donald is not going to win it
hry7ydh,2022-01-09 16:06:08,Same here changed my t shirt and got into my jersey
hry7y4g,2022-01-09 16:06:06,Skinny one
hry7xju,2022-01-09 16:06:01,"2 runs up the middle for 1 yard each, then hail Mary into double coverage with Baltimore interception"
hry7xgj,2022-01-09 16:06:00,Same. If favre lying down counts then so does this one.
hry7xdl,2022-01-09 16:05:59,"So does Ben and Snell, obviously.  Trying to max his chances."
hry7x9u,2022-01-09 16:05:58,Lol I'm more worried about this game
hry7tx7,2022-01-09 16:05:26,which punter is more impressive right now
hry7ttd,2022-01-09 16:05:25,Take the earpiece out Ben let‚Äôs go win this
hry7tgi,2022-01-09 16:05:22,These 2 games are going to go down to the wire...WATCH lol
hry7tdg,2022-01-09 16:05:21,Still not sure how the first one wasn‚Äôt a sack
hry7t2y,2022-01-09 16:05:19,Haha if the Steelers make it they might be the worst playoff team of all time
hry7sjr,2022-01-09 16:05:14,"Wouldn‚Äôt mind, but I feel like we‚Äôre stuck with Mason"
hry7sgi,2022-01-09 16:05:13,It‚Äôs Benny Fucking Snell time!
hry7s8b,2022-01-09 16:05:10,"Honestly, same. Is that wrong? lol"
hry7s7f,2022-01-09 16:05:10,Seconded.  I'd rather he obliterate the record over getting in the playoffs.
hry7rpv,2022-01-09 16:05:05,Packers fan here watching for the record
hry7rni,2022-01-09 16:05:05,Fuck the Ravens and the NFL scorers. The record should be tied and the way Harbaugh is designing shit I doubt that TJ gets the record. He is getting doubled and tripled every rush and they‚Äôre throwing quick passes. Bullshit way just for the AP to justify giving the DPOY to Aaron Donald‚Ä¶
hry7rmw,2022-01-09 16:05:05,Wow unbelievable
hry7rku,2022-01-09 16:05:04,When they listed the players that aren‚Äôt playing today his name was on the list because of Covid
hry7rhq,2022-01-09 16:05:03,Who gets the ball first in second half of jags game?
hry7rh7,2022-01-09 16:05:03,"‡ºº „Å§ ‚óï_‚óï ‡ºΩ„Å§ TJ Watt take my energy ‡ºº „Å§ ‚óï_‚óï ‡ºΩ„Å§

hry7r14,2022-01-09 16:04:59,More runs up the middle??
hry7qkb,2022-01-09 16:04:55,"This a joke. He literally had the record, but he was literally stolen a sack and now Huntley COME ON.."
hry7qg8,2022-01-09 16:04:54,Ditto.
hry7qb1,2022-01-09 16:04:52,Cmon ben. Tell Canada to fuck off
hry7ncf,2022-01-09 16:04:24,"TJ had the big donger in hand, doing a lasso-dick motion, and Huntley just barely got that ball off."
hry7miw,2022-01-09 16:04:16,"I‚Äôm gonna keep saying it, POSITIVE AFFIRMATION

LETS GO"
hry7mgz,2022-01-09 16:04:16,"I don‚Äôt care about playoffs, just want Watt to have this record"
hry7meo,2022-01-09 16:04:15,Josh Allen is good at football
hry7mbs,2022-01-09 16:04:15,My stream is at least 20 seconds behind lol
hry7kyj,2022-01-09 16:04:02,"I don't think ever been blue balled so hard. Come on TJ, don't leave me hanging"
hry7kpp,2022-01-09 16:04:00,That was close enough that they should just give it to Watt.
hry7kgl,2022-01-09 16:03:57,DAMN IT SO CLOSE
hry7kb7,2022-01-09 16:03:56,GOOD SHIT BOYS. Love the bump on Andrews from Maulet
hry7jox,2022-01-09 16:03:50,Yes
hry7jj0,2022-01-09 16:03:49,Same. I would love to get Ben to the playoffs but we would get steamrolled by the chiefs again
hry7fch,2022-01-09 16:03:10,I want TJ to get the record more than I want the Steelers to make the playoffs bros
hry7fb8,2022-01-09 16:03:09,So goddam close.
hry7fak,2022-01-09 16:03:09,See they had a guy there chipping him
hry7f12,2022-01-09 16:03:07,How many is TJ at? 1 more to tie?
hry7elg,2022-01-09 16:03:02,Good tackle joe
hry7e92,2022-01-09 16:02:59,You suck huntley!

hry7cd3,2022-01-09 16:02:40,Is Canada calling plays for both teams?
hry7c9k,2022-01-09 16:02:39,Thank you for fixing that!
hry77pw,2022-01-09 16:01:54,TJ strip sack coming up
hry77pf,2022-01-09 16:01:54,They got a much harder path
hry76nf,2022-01-09 16:01:44,Just another Steel and Teal Sunday
hry7606,2022-01-09 16:01:38,"Would be the ultimate ball smack if the ravens win, jaguars win, and the ravens make the playoffs lmao"
hry75wi,2022-01-09 16:01:36,"Figured out what was wrong‚Ä¶ I was only wearing a Steelers shirt and not my #90 jersey.

Jersey‚Äôs on now, game‚Äôs gonna look different now. You‚Äôre welcome, everyone! üëçüèΩ"
hry75wh,2022-01-09 16:01:36,Horrible spot
hry75w1,2022-01-09 16:01:36,Didn't he slide well short of the sticks
hry75f1,2022-01-09 16:01:32,Huntley has some beautiful passes. More game time and he can be dangerous.
hry759f,2022-01-09 16:01:30,"Come on, give us TJ at least"
hry72b7,2022-01-09 16:01:01,Our offense is depressing
hry721m,2022-01-09 16:00:59,"Fucking harvin is trash; also, what happened to najee? Bouncing between a bunch of different stuff"
hry71ox,2022-01-09 16:00:55,Regarding Harvin. The guy has had a rough  60 days. Where is the humanity around here?
hry71bd,2022-01-09 16:00:52,Probable to return
hry716f,2022-01-09 16:00:50,I think Jags should have went for it
hry70vi,2022-01-09 16:00:48,A pro punter should be able to pin an opponent inside the ten with no return from that spot on the field.
hry70sl,2022-01-09 16:00:47,10-3 Jag offs
hry70g5,2022-01-09 16:00:43,Jags doing their part.
hry6zz7,2022-01-09 16:00:39,I mean fuck it. I would do it regardless
hry6zuz,2022-01-09 16:00:38,Next half.
hry6z85,2022-01-09 16:00:31,I am not exaggerating. I don‚Äôt give a shit about the playoffs. I just want TJ to break that gap-toothed fucker‚Äôs record. Please just let him get a sack so I can relax.
hry6z3d,2022-01-09 16:00:30,"Jacksonville field goal. They lead 10-3, but you really wanted a td there."
hry6z0i,2022-01-09 16:00:29,Offence has been giving so many good field positions and we have 3 points to show for it
hry6ysb,2022-01-09 16:00:27,Dri was a 3rd round. This dude was the 3rd last pick of the draft. Hardly comparable. Although Harvin is genuinely hurting the team significantly every game
hry6ys7,2022-01-09 16:00:27,You spelled Artie burns name wrong
hry6ys3,2022-01-09 16:00:27,He should definitely be competing for the spot next season
hry6w6t,2022-01-09 16:00:01,Ben has been throwing hospital passes all season.
hry6vjg,2022-01-09 15:59:55,Ben looks awful this game. Like he's shitting out floaters
hry6uw7,2022-01-09 15:59:49,Bruh give me Waitman next season please
hry6urr,2022-01-09 15:59:48,"I know Harvin is dealing with a lot off the field, so I won't judge this season too harshly. With that being said, he's gotta be a lot better next season if he wants to keep his job"
hry6ur5,2022-01-09 15:59:48,Punt boy
hry6uo6,2022-01-09 15:59:47,üé∂ BLAME CANADA üé∂
hry6ul4,2022-01-09 15:59:46,At least this one got inside the 20‚Ä¶ barely

hry6u4v,2022-01-09 15:59:42,Lol they're saying the rain made DJ slip we all know he slips when it's 72 and sunny
hry6u0c,2022-01-09 15:59:40,He‚Äôs probable to return
hry6ttu,2022-01-09 15:59:39,Really disappointing game from Harvin so far
hry6tlp,2022-01-09 15:59:37,Welp lets run the ball again because that works
hry6tl9,2022-01-09 15:59:37,Or that if you just get three yards you might be going for it on 4th
hry6thz,2022-01-09 15:59:36,He‚Äôs out‚Ä¶Covid
hry6tf6,2022-01-09 15:59:35,Harvin has had 3 chances to easily pin them in their 15 and has failed all three times.
hry6t83,2022-01-09 15:59:33,Well at least the Jags/Colts game is looking pretty good.
hry6t57,2022-01-09 15:59:32,He slipped? That had nothing to do with toughness.
hry6t53,2022-01-09 15:59:32,"Official report is ""probable."" If this were the Super Bowl he probably comes back in. But they've had to fit him with a brace and practice not fumbling. And it's raining. Unless its the 4th and Jacksonville looks like it's secured a win and we are ahead and need to ice the game, I don't know if he comes in."
hry6t1v,2022-01-09 15:59:31,This is some of the worst offense I've ever seen.
hry6szk,2022-01-09 15:59:31,Don't look now but here come the Jags
hry6srx,2022-01-09 15:59:28,26 yard punt Jesus christ I could punt that far
hry6pxm,2022-01-09 15:59:00,This team is trash. The jags will win the Steelers will lose
hry6prr,2022-01-09 15:58:58,"My God, these punts. My kid could hit it farther."
hry6pld,2022-01-09 15:58:56,"Not saying he deserved it, but I'm not surprised queen got hurt, he's been running around recklessly in this first half"
hry6pkx,2022-01-09 15:58:56,"Do you think if we offered all of our worst players who we hate, the Jags would trade us Trevor Lawrence?"
hry6pbc,2022-01-09 15:58:54,If the jaguars win and we can‚Äôt get it done that would be sad. May take me weeks to recover from that
hry6p6t,2022-01-09 15:58:53,Fichtner for sure
hry6ou6,2022-01-09 15:58:49,Jax about to score
hry6o5d,2022-01-09 15:58:43,That was a 26 yard punt....
hry6nuw,2022-01-09 15:58:40,He has covid
hry6nob,2022-01-09 15:58:38,"Elbow injury, probable to return"
hry6n1g,2022-01-09 15:58:32,We have the softest WR in the league with out juju
hry6n15,2022-01-09 15:58:32,This offense makes me want to stay my eyeballs out
hry6mpn,2022-01-09 15:58:29,He's gonna be a cheap TE2 and he's decent. I love it
hry6j23,2022-01-09 15:57:54,Serious question: Matt canada or randy sphincter ?
hry6iz4,2022-01-09 15:57:53,"Sure, I see your point."

hry6hui,2022-01-09 15:57:42,I heard someone say he‚Äôs going to play but haven‚Äôt seen him.
hry6hra,2022-01-09 15:57:41,After the stunt harbaugh pulled in Denver there‚Äôs no chance he‚Äôs letting TJ have a shot at the record
hry6hlg,2022-01-09 15:57:40,Wait...you mean they aren't both MUUUUUTH?
hry6hdu,2022-01-09 15:57:38,Resign Gentry this off-season before he gets expensive. They'll have the money
hry6hcw,2022-01-09 15:57:37,Send Canada to a Siberian gulag I sentence him to 15 years hard labor
hry6hbh,2022-01-09 15:57:37,I love having Ray Ray run all over the place behind the line. Helps absolutely nothing.
hry6h7f,2022-01-09 15:57:36,"RUN, THROW BEHIND THE LINE OH MY GOD FUCJING STOP"
hry6h5r,2022-01-09 15:57:35,"Canada is really out here running bootlegs and plays requiring Ben to move laterally as our primary passing plays against the worst secondary in the league... Seriously, fuck this guy"
hry6h57,2022-01-09 15:57:35,STOP RUNNING!
hry6h50,2022-01-09 15:57:35,"You're wrong.  Ed clearly had once had his luggage lost at the Pittsburgh Airport,  or had his cat run away in the city, or solemn.  He HATED the Steelers."

hry6a2h,2022-01-09 15:56:27,I can't wait to see this run game when teams have to defend the pass with the QB under center
hry69tw,2022-01-09 15:56:25,That pass to Gentry seemed to float in the air for a long time. lol

hry5unt,2022-01-09 15:53:58,"Dude honestly. If you told me since week 12 that he leads the Steelers‚Äô receivers in targets, then I‚Äôd totally believe you. McCloud does nothing with them and doesn‚Äôt run good routes. He has a few good grabs here and there but he‚Äôs a professional receiver so it makes sense. I have no fucking clue why he‚Äôs out targeting guys like Claypool and occasionally DJ. I‚Äôm so fucking sick of this offense that I‚Äôd rather have Todd Haley and Randy Fichtner procreate and their creation as OC would provide more enjoyment."

hry5jj7,2022-01-09 15:52:09,EDMUNDS POPPING OFF
hry5j53,2022-01-09 15:52:05,It‚Äôs a credit to the defense that we are up in this game because the offensive decision making so far has been absolutely horrendous
hry5iyd,2022-01-09 15:52:03,If he was on the Steelers I wouldn‚Äôt complain
hry5ihf,2022-01-09 15:51:59,1st down for the Jags
hry5idb,2022-01-09 15:51:58,"Ravens handing us this game on a silver fucking platter. 

**MAKE THEM PAY**"
hry5ice,2022-01-09 15:51:58,Huntley wants another interception.
hry5i0y,2022-01-09 15:51:54,Time for the Ray Ray show guys lol
hry5hzg,2022-01-09 15:51:54,I don't see Rodolph guiding the sleigh. I look for them to make a splash in FA while they have the cap space.
hry5cur,2022-01-09 15:51:06,"I think the refs are letting close calls play out just in case it was a turnover 

I like that"
hry5cub,2022-01-09 15:51:05,As called in the huddle yes but the bad snap technically turned it into a run play
hry5cu6,2022-01-09 15:51:05,Wtf was that refs
hry5c0b,2022-01-09 15:50:57,‚ÄúI wonder why they thought it was an interception‚Äù fucking Christ we got the reject announcers this game didn‚Äôt we.
hry5bme,2022-01-09 15:50:53,lmao what was all that extra shit even though it hit the ground wtf
hry5b9w,2022-01-09 15:50:50,Well if we do make the playoffs we will not have a team anyways it looks like
hry5b7k,2022-01-09 15:50:50,These announcers are brain dead.
hry5b22,2022-01-09 15:50:48,That female athletic trainer looks thick I love it.
hry5ax3,2022-01-09 15:50:47,Why didn't they blow the fucking whistle?
hry5aw1,2022-01-09 15:50:46,If we somehow squeak into the playoffs it's going to be an absolute bloodbath in the first round.
hry5a8p,2022-01-09 15:50:40,Player safety btw
hry5a59,2022-01-09 15:50:39,"""The ruling on the field is an incomplete pass...""

""... we just never blew a whistle."""
hry5a4l,2022-01-09 15:50:39,I can‚Äôt figure out why
hry59ut,2022-01-09 15:50:36,"Btw:

Jacksonville is winning!"
hry59qd,2022-01-09 15:50:35,TF was that?
hry59ik,2022-01-09 15:50:33,These refs swallow their fuckin whistle???
hry59cr,2022-01-09 15:50:31,FLORIDA MAN LETS GOOOOO
hry55mr,2022-01-09 15:49:56,Why let him run wild if your gonna call it incomplete
hry53x0,2022-01-09 15:49:38,The Steelers employ Matt Canada we don‚Äôt deserve a fucking thing
hry53ri,2022-01-09 15:49:37,Is corliss waitman gonna come back to camp to compete? He better
hry53k3,2022-01-09 15:49:35,Heinz 57
hry52ul,2022-01-09 15:49:28,What is even going on lol
hry52f2,2022-01-09 15:49:24,Is Ray Ray signed for next year? I never need to see him play football again
hry52ej,2022-01-09 15:49:24,Just give TJ Watt the sack record right now.
hry52c8,2022-01-09 15:49:23,Why we don‚Äôt target Pat 10 times a game baffles me
hry4zcu,2022-01-09 15:48:53,that third down call and play was tough because it was so long the ravens knew we had to pass and needed time to develop
hry4yuy,2022-01-09 15:48:49,No?  Just bitching with everyone else
hry4yl7,2022-01-09 15:48:46,Harvin hitting 30 yard punts like a high school 2nd stringer.
hry4yc1,2022-01-09 15:48:43,Holy horeshit calls Batman
hry4y9v,2022-01-09 15:48:43,Okay negative Nancy.
hry4y2f,2022-01-09 15:48:41,Where is waitman?
hry4xx2,2022-01-09 15:48:39,I havent seen Ben throw a hard ball across the middle in a long time.   3rd and long always been short throws.   Shoulder injury???
hry4xt6,2022-01-09 15:48:38,It's funny that the OC gets shit for calling quick passes right after the o-line gets blown up by multiple defenders for a 5 yard loss on a run and not long after Ben threw a horrible deep pass into double coverage.
hry4xat,2022-01-09 15:48:33,I got them at +15.5 on Friday I‚Äôm loving that decision lol
hry4x67,2022-01-09 15:48:32,Yeah Big Ben is really going to fire one in on a rope on a 15 yard out or down the seam and our line is going to give him the time for those routes to develop.
hry4x2d,2022-01-09 15:48:31,I don't even know how they are in the NFL let alone playing
hry4wt3,2022-01-09 15:48:29,Probably would've been a decent gain if he didn't have to make a one handed catch low
hry4wig,2022-01-09 15:48:26,Ravens could never see that screen coming lol
hry4wia,2022-01-09 15:48:26,"They were playing soft zone, we could have had an easy 7-9 yard pass, then who knows, maybe you get a fortunate YAC. That's the smart call.

Canada dials up a lateral pass behind the line of scrimmage that the entire defense can see and line up the receiver."
hry4wb6,2022-01-09 15:48:24,The ghost of Todd Haley is loving it.
hry4tej,2022-01-09 15:47:56,I feel like I'm watching Todd Haley 2.0.
hry4td9,2022-01-09 15:47:56,How about not throw it to McCloud on 1st down one-on-one in the open field behind the line of scrimmage and expect him to make something happen? Because that down put the offense behind the sticks for the remainder of the posession. But sure feign ignorance that it was the third down play that was the issue.
hry4t61,2022-01-09 15:47:54,To be fair Queen‚Äôs strength is against the run
hry4svx,2022-01-09 15:47:51,Tomlin is calling defense right?
hry4stk,2022-01-09 15:47:51,3rd and short bomb it.  3rd and long screen pass. I don't get it.
hry4skh,2022-01-09 15:47:48,Waitman has Covid
hry4sf3,2022-01-09 15:47:47,No helmet this week
hry4ses,2022-01-09 15:47:46,"Baltimore: 3 turnovers
Pittsburgh: 3 points
Fucking barf"
hry4sbk,2022-01-09 15:47:46,What would everyone do on that 3rd down play? With the o line and the corpse of Ben Roethlisberger you're looking at absolutely nothing good happening
hry4rx3,2022-01-09 15:47:42,We forced two turnover and one turnover on downs and put up incredible 3 points.
hry4rgo,2022-01-09 15:47:37,Why is Harvin back in when we did just fine punting on Monday with Waitman?
hry4rgb,2022-01-09 15:47:37,tomlin likes em thiccc
hry4rf3,2022-01-09 15:47:37,I‚Äôm so sick of seeing Ray Ray and Benny Snell.
hry4rdh,2022-01-09 15:47:36,Love Ben. And in what might be his last game I hate to say this but we just cannot move the ball well with him back there. He just can‚Äôt get the ball down field anymore with accuracy and not having that threat just kills an offense
hry4qxp,2022-01-09 15:47:32,Any more power on that and duvernay leaves it for a touchback
hry4quq,2022-01-09 15:47:31,Big Dan was a legend lol
hry4qlu,2022-01-09 15:47:29,Waitman is so much better than Harvin
hry4qkq,2022-01-09 15:47:29,You could screen a whole porch with Canada‚Äôs 3rd down playbook
hry4qk3,2022-01-09 15:47:28,Weak ass third down play as usual. Canada needs to go
hry4q9g,2022-01-09 15:47:26,Do they think Ray Ray is Heinz Ward or something?
hry4q81,2022-01-09 15:47:25,Harvin blows
hry4q4d,2022-01-09 15:47:24,I absolutely hate our 3rd and long playcalling
hry4pp0,2022-01-09 15:47:20,did anyone notice Bush knock the ball out of Edmunds hands on the pick
hry4m1h,2022-01-09 15:46:45,"Rey Rey was targeted on all passing plays that drive, please don‚Äôt tell me it‚Äôs that type of game."
hry4m15,2022-01-09 15:46:45,Usually he's the one getting sued.
hry4ltt,2022-01-09 15:46:43,At least we extended our league lead of the throwing behind the line on 3rd and long‚Ä¶
hry4lpj,2022-01-09 15:46:42,"At this point, I have more hope in getting a defensive touchdown."
hry4lme,2022-01-09 15:46:41,Another terrible punt by Harvin.
hry4lkq,2022-01-09 15:46:41,"God , we suck ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Seriously, wtf are we gonna do in the playoffs if we would happen to make it other than be embarrassed?"
hry4l90,2022-01-09 15:46:38,If the Jags win and we lose I'm going to lose my god damn mind
hry4l32,2022-01-09 15:46:36,We almost got it with that screen /s
hry4l1n,2022-01-09 15:46:36,This team wastes so much good field position
hry4l1g,2022-01-09 15:46:36,No idea how that wasn‚Äôt a fumble
hry4kus,2022-01-09 15:46:34,this is the team steelers fans want to limp into the playoffs.
hry4ktx,2022-01-09 15:46:34,Be alright with that too.  They‚Äôre going to have to do something.
hry4ks8,2022-01-09 15:46:33,SCREEN PASS ON THIRD AND SIXTEEN OF FUCKING COURSE
hry4ks3,2022-01-09 15:46:33,"What would you like him to do on that 3rd down, what would you do? The offensive line is awful, but even if he has enough time we don't have a QB that can put proper zip on the ball to put one on a tight window."
hry4krh,2022-01-09 15:46:33,Yeah that was expected
hry4kq7,2022-01-09 15:46:32,It's Canada
hry4klp,2022-01-09 15:46:31,Matt Canada is **dogshit**
hry4kje,2022-01-09 15:46:31,also I love when we just give up on a drive by throwing a screen or running a draw when you need sixteen fucking yards
hry4kg4,2022-01-09 15:46:30,12-10 Steelers
hry4k5v,2022-01-09 15:46:27,If we‚Äôre putting the fate of the offense in the hands of Snell & McCloud all day.... it‚Äôs going to be a rough one lmaoo
hry4k4c,2022-01-09 15:46:27,Colts kick FG 7-3 Jax
hry4k3p,2022-01-09 15:46:27,Not appreciating this reminder of how much of a band aid Najee is for this offense.
hry4jxk,2022-01-09 15:46:25,Fire Matt Canada.
hry4juv,2022-01-09 15:46:24,"Lol when did Ray Ray become the focal point of the offense? Been incredibly frustrating. He doesn‚Äôt suck, but he‚Äôs not that guy"
hry4jua,2022-01-09 15:46:24,Stop trying to make McCloud a thing.
hry4jqj,2022-01-09 15:46:23,"I hate Matt Canada‚Ä¶seriously, I don‚Äôt care if Ben is shot, the O-line sucks, whatever. They run the most basic pathetic offense I‚Äôve ever seen. Until Ben starts calling plays in the second half."
hry4jon,2022-01-09 15:46:23,We‚Äôre the only team that just gives up on 3rd and long
hry4jnn,2022-01-09 15:46:22,I miss our teams that had an amazing offense and dogshit defense. At least those teams weren't boring af to watch
hry4jld,2022-01-09 15:46:22,34 yard punt man I can‚Äôt this whole team sucks
hry4jkz,2022-01-09 15:46:22,I want us to win and get in but watching this offense makes me question why.
hry4jk9,2022-01-09 15:46:21,"In this offense, every play is a Ryan Switzer pass."
hry4jg3,2022-01-09 15:46:20,Does Ben see 14 and think it‚Äôs 84?  He really misses AB‚Ä¶
hry4jg1,2022-01-09 15:46:20,Honestly neither of these teams should be in the playoffs.
hry4jbb,2022-01-09 15:46:19,literally screaming let's go at the jags gettin the sack lol.
hry4j5p,2022-01-09 15:46:18,"I'm so fucking tired of seeing this same play calling. ""It's third and seventeen let's throw a one yard pass"" might as well run the damn ball at least it wouldn't be expected"
hry4iy5,2022-01-09 15:46:16,These third down plays are just trolling at this point
hry4ioj,2022-01-09 15:46:13,"Nah, too many players missing this season."
hry4idl,2022-01-09 15:46:10,Honestly fuck you Canada. I don‚Äôt care who your players are that‚Äôs the wrong call. They know you always throw to the sticks there anyway
hry4iby,2022-01-09 15:46:10,"Ah yes, time for another commercial break"
hry4i7z,2022-01-09 15:46:09,Harvin is really bad
hry4i74,2022-01-09 15:46:09,The jags are coming through and we‚Äôre fucking it up. So predictable
hry4e2h,2022-01-09 15:45:28,Does Matt Canada really think we're going to win this game featuring Ray Ray Mc-Fucking-Cloud on offense?
hry4e1g,2022-01-09 15:45:28,pass behind the line of scrimmage on 3rd and 16. Fire matt canada into the sun
hry4e0l,2022-01-09 15:45:28,What a display of offensive prowess
hry4e0j,2022-01-09 15:45:28,3RD AND LONG SCREEN FUCKKKKKK
hry4dy3,2022-01-09 15:45:27,Unreal pal‚Ä¶unreal.
hry4dvv,2022-01-09 15:45:27,They have no practice with snell in there
hry4doo,2022-01-09 15:45:24,3rd and 16 4 yard route
hry4do5,2022-01-09 15:45:24,Why the fuck is McCloud getting so many touches
hry4dms,2022-01-09 15:45:24,FFS
hry4dg8,2022-01-09 15:45:22,These are not playoff caliber teams.
hry4dfv,2022-01-09 15:45:22,Fuck you Matt!
hry4de3,2022-01-09 15:45:21,God I hate watching RayRay on offense.
hry4dbq,2022-01-09 15:45:21,Need jags to hold to a fg
hry4d2j,2022-01-09 15:45:18,I miss Najee.
hry4cxs,2022-01-09 15:45:17,Watching this offense sucks
hry4cvp,2022-01-09 15:45:16,wtf lol
hry4co2,2022-01-09 15:45:14,McCloud!
hry4cj0,2022-01-09 15:45:13,JAGS SACK HOLDS COLTS TO 3
hry4chm,2022-01-09 15:45:13,Josh Allen! Sack!
hry4cfy,2022-01-09 15:45:12,Let‚Äôs see half the sub blame that on Snell
hry4c5x,2022-01-09 15:45:09,What is this fucking play calling
hry4c2z,2022-01-09 15:45:08,Ohh ok that makes sense. But why is he considered a runner if he can still pass the ball after picking it up? I thought you weren't considered a runner until you crossed the line of scrimmage.
hry4c0u,2022-01-09 15:45:08,The line just standing around going WTF
hry4by7,2022-01-09 15:45:07,Why do we keep running it holy shit man throw the damn ball
hry4bod,2022-01-09 15:45:05,The past few weeks ray ray‚Äôs been playing like he really wants to be a part of the offense
hry4bmm,2022-01-09 15:45:04,dear god in heaven
hry4amd,2022-01-09 15:44:55,"Brother in law moved here from another country.  Exposed to NFL for the first time...  ""Why is it all commercials?""  Welcome to US and A"
hry4al9,2022-01-09 15:44:55,What's the final score going to be?
hry47wi,2022-01-09 15:44:30,"Harbaugh is such a dog shit coach.  Got carried by Ozzie Newsome giving him top shelf talent all the time.  Left to figure football out for himself, he puts running backs at quarterback and sits the best kicker in history on the sidelines so his RB's can try to throw for two, over and over again.  That fake was classic Harbaugh.

I want a long and prosperous future full of Harbaugh, Stefanski, Lamar, and Baker.  We'll have to figure something out about Cinci, but historically, that hasn't been too hard a code to crack."
hry47vu,2022-01-09 15:44:30,When did Ray Ray become Jerry Rice?
hry47q8,2022-01-09 15:44:28,Lol Ray Ray is the best WR on the team I guess
hry47na,2022-01-09 15:44:28,Why the fuck are we trying to feature Ray Ray McCloud. Who cares if he has little 1-handed catches. He does nothing before or after the catch.
hry47kf,2022-01-09 15:44:27,Screen play is Ben worst play
hry47dy,2022-01-09 15:44:25,FR they could have 11 wins if he wasn't such a bone head.
hry47av,2022-01-09 15:44:24,Basically a screen with no blockers.  brilliant.
hry477l,2022-01-09 15:44:23,Great play call Canada. Please hire a new OC.
hry476z,2022-01-09 15:44:23,It was like three years ago we were saying imagine this offense with a competent defense
hry46kh,2022-01-09 15:44:17,"Yeah, respect for that tbh"
hry45w2,2022-01-09 15:44:10,what the fuck is their obsession with ray ray
hry45lq,2022-01-09 15:44:07,This is the 3rd time the offense starts with good field position. Offense better do something
hry44wm,2022-01-09 15:44:00,I feel an unhealthy use of Ray Ray this drive.
hry44na,2022-01-09 15:43:58,Aborted snap and subjectivity of Huntley trying to run. That's not ruled a sack by the rules.
hry44fx,2022-01-09 15:43:56,T-Law about to have the game of his career.  11-11 100+ yards 1 TD.
hry41py,2022-01-09 15:43:29,"At the 50, I could see it.   Deep in your own zone?  Nah."
hry41my,2022-01-09 15:43:28,You‚Äôre fun‚Ä¶.
hry41mm,2022-01-09 15:43:28,The Snap was aborted and Huntley picked it up and tried to continue the play. Watt got there and stripped it but because it was an aborted play (and Huntley looked like he might try to run) they only gave him credit for the tackle and forced fumble.
hry41aq,2022-01-09 15:43:25,Same lmfao i was like watch these fuckers fake
hry418r,2022-01-09 15:43:25,We‚Äôve been saying that for 3 seasons now lol. I‚Äôm afraid it won‚Äôt happen
hry4161,2022-01-09 15:43:24,He always finds new creative ways to stall the offense out.
hry40nq,2022-01-09 15:43:19,"That‚Äôs interesting to me though. Say he scrambled outside of the pocket still looking to pass‚Ä¶ you‚Äôd have to rule that a sack, right?"
hry4000,2022-01-09 15:43:13,Hate the ravens but love the pair of danglers harbaugh has between his legs. Wish more coaches had the guts to call stuff like that
hry3zyt,2022-01-09 15:43:12,"Everyone knew that fake was coming, why not line up and go for it with offense?"
hry3zng,2022-01-09 15:43:09,"Harbaugh's constant need to be ""unpredictable"" is the most predictable thing in the league lmao"
hry3zk6,2022-01-09 15:43:08,"Canada threw that pick, face it Ben has been ABYSMAL. He's going to have to majorly step up his game if they want to win"
hry3zj0,2022-01-09 15:43:07,Pandering to the ‚Äúwoke‚Äù community
hry3z96,2022-01-09 15:43:05,"Nope, got a first"
hry3z6k,2022-01-09 15:43:04,Guess is because he was already kinda falling but yeah even if he touched him down it should be a sack.
hry3z4w,2022-01-09 15:43:04,"If you're a team that thinks they are the under dog, it makes sense to go for higher risk higher reward type plays."
hry3yz0,2022-01-09 15:43:02,Except there's no fucking way in hell the Ravens put Tucker out to get killed
hry3yrh,2022-01-09 15:43:00,Fuckinnn what? They telegraphed the shit out of that lol
hry3ycm,2022-01-09 15:42:56,My favorite part of this season is Harbaugh just throwing games away for no reason

hry3sop,2022-01-09 15:42:01,I think he‚Äôs on the covid list
hry3smt,2022-01-09 15:42:01,What do you mean?

hry3ryf,2022-01-09 15:41:54,That looked as bad as when the Steelers run a fake.
hry3ryd,2022-01-09 15:41:54,"Just started watching, can you clue me in"
hry3rv6,2022-01-09 15:41:53,Undoubtedly we will not get a touchdown on this drive.
hry3rmj,2022-01-09 15:41:51,There was a play that looked like a sack but they didn't count it.
hry3rgf,2022-01-09 15:41:49,Not sure that guy knew it was a fake and got leveled
hry3nms,2022-01-09 15:41:12,He won 15 straight as a rookie. I'd take that for a change.
hry3nj0,2022-01-09 15:41:11,"I'm all for giving a guy chances but Holy fuck it's been bad. Our offense isn't great, but the talent shouldn't be a bottom unit like they are."
hry3ni7,2022-01-09 15:41:10,Remember the Madden cam for like a preseason game 3 years ago?
hry3n53,2022-01-09 15:41:07,Lmao

hry3lej,2022-01-09 15:40:50,How bout them Jags!!
hry3l8q,2022-01-09 15:40:48,"Statistically, Spillane has been just as good in coverage this year as Bush and Schobert."
hry3l5j,2022-01-09 15:40:48,I‚Äôll say this out loud.. if the Steelers can‚Äôt sign a QB they should get Fitz magic for next season.  He could be something else with this defense.
hry3kye,2022-01-09 15:40:46,"Ben needs to stay in since it's his last game, but Ben is having an abysmal couple games right now. Accuracy and decision making is just not there."
hry3hvw,2022-01-09 15:40:16,Can‚Äôt play worse than ben is playing right now
hry3hlw,2022-01-09 15:40:13,"because ray ray can only run fly routes so he plays the Y position in formation, if we had depth claypool would be at the Y and running those"
hry3hef,2022-01-09 15:40:11,"Their gameplan right now is run run pass apparently 

Should start run then pass"
hry3hd5,2022-01-09 15:40:11,Not yet

hry38di,2022-01-09 15:38:45,He's got no one else right now
hry38ak,2022-01-09 15:38:44,Ben needs 5 TD passes now to get to 422/211.
hry3814,2022-01-09 15:38:41,got hit in the ribs
hry37xy,2022-01-09 15:38:41,"Ok let‚Äôs be logical.
Plenty of football left to be played, and we look better than some of our worst games that we managed to win

Jags appear to be holding off the colts for now

Positive energy only manifest this W"

hry32q0,2022-01-09 15:37:50,Joe Sloebert out there getting smoked lol

hry32ld,2022-01-09 15:37:49,What happened
hry32dh,2022-01-09 15:37:47,Matt Canada
hry31uw,2022-01-09 15:37:42,Schobert is awful to watch
hry31tg,2022-01-09 15:37:41,Joe Schobert out here waddlin around in pass coverage.
hry31o1,2022-01-09 15:37:40,This thread is confusing.
hry31ke,2022-01-09 15:37:39,We need faster MLBs. Watching Schobert move laterally is painful.
hry31j8,2022-01-09 15:37:38,2 turnovers and we have 3 points to show for it. Ugh
hry31dg,2022-01-09 15:37:37,"Go watch the replay again. Bush absolutely knocked it out. Edmunds didn‚Äôt have great control, but he didn‚Äôt lose it until Bush came in and hit Edmunds‚Äô arm."
hry317x,2022-01-09 15:37:35,Dammit jags
hry3162,2022-01-09 15:37:35,An underneath route for 10+. All day long.
hry30q1,2022-01-09 15:37:31,End Q1 in Jacksonville: Jaguars 7 - Colts 0
hry2wp1,2022-01-09 15:36:52,Helps that Najee has only played like one snap
hry2wev,2022-01-09 15:36:49,\*blink\* holy shit i never realized that
hry2we3,2022-01-09 15:36:49,No just Lebruon marketing a cable machine. Looks like a pelaton cult like thing
hry2vuv,2022-01-09 15:36:43,This defense is keeping us in the hunt in spite of the offensive woes.
hry2vld,2022-01-09 15:36:41,Nah he's a HOF QB and Ballage is a bum. It's Ballage's fault.
hry2v2m,2022-01-09 15:36:36,For every second the Jags lead my stomach is doing a million backflips
hry2uji,2022-01-09 15:36:31,What‚Äôs his Twitter?
hry2ufw,2022-01-09 15:36:30,I feel like this is going to end up being a Mr. 3000 kind of thing. Where the ravens know TJ is going for the record so they're going to run mostly runs and quick passes all day
hry2tvw,2022-01-09 15:36:24,He‚Äôs not hurt he‚Äôs in now
hry2py6,2022-01-09 15:35:47,Exactly.  He knew that was going to be an INT
hry2pxg,2022-01-09 15:35:46,D didn't even know who had the ball there
hry2pc6,2022-01-09 15:35:41,I meant for the past two months. They started giving him less playing weeks ago and it‚Äôs only gotten worse.
hry2p7c,2022-01-09 15:35:39,Is anyone else getting that Tom Brady Superbowl commercial on like every break?
hry2p1d,2022-01-09 15:35:38,"Ben needs to step up today, im not so sure he can at this point"
hry2ox8,2022-01-09 15:35:36,Yet another Minkah RB tackle
hry2opl,2022-01-09 15:35:34,Ballage turns around and does his job the interception never happens. Gotta help your QB out there.
hry2o2s,2022-01-09 15:35:28,"The classic don‚Äôt throw ball out just chuck it up and if it‚Äôs intercepted then it‚Äôs a punt 

If you don‚Äôt like that you don‚Äôt like Big Ben football"
hry2mqo,2022-01-09 15:35:15,The fact that there are people out there thinking that this INT is on RayRay is crazy.
hry2mn8,2022-01-09 15:35:14,Just heard announcers say he's probable to return - has a brace on his elbow now
hry2iy4,2022-01-09 15:34:38,Classic shit Ben and Canada play throwing in double coverage to McCloud. Has he ever heard of a throw away?
hry2id2,2022-01-09 15:34:33,I may be missing the sarcasm here but Washington is on the COVID list
hry2i1d,2022-01-09 15:34:29,He wasn‚Äôt.
hry2hx0,2022-01-09 15:34:28,Said nobody ever
hry2hs2,2022-01-09 15:34:27,Ray Ray is not that guy lol
hry2h84,2022-01-09 15:34:21,Just from that throwing motion I knew a pick was coming. Serious lack of confidence behind that throw
hry2h19,2022-01-09 15:34:20,Nailed it. Ugh this team in the first half is so mind boggling. Ravens literally playing 4th stringers in the secondary
hry2gwo,2022-01-09 15:34:19,"not a great throw by ben, but what was mccloud doing there hand fighting with the db instead of tracking the ball?"
hry2gk6,2022-01-09 15:34:15,Thanks Ben?
hry2ggi,2022-01-09 15:34:14,Dumb ass play to send it to Ray Ray but it isn't like Claypool is catching a goddamn pass any time soon so I guess I get it?
hry2g85,2022-01-09 15:34:12,Joined game late what happened to Najee?
hry2fwo,2022-01-09 15:34:09,Throwing to Ray Ray in double coverage is counter-productive
hry2fwh,2022-01-09 15:34:09,That was an obvious pick the moment it left his hand. Just looked off.
hry2ft6,2022-01-09 15:34:08,"Ahh, thats nice to see. Ben hasn't been arm punting much lately"
hry2fn3,2022-01-09 15:34:06,"It‚Äôs okay to throw the ball away on 1st and 10, Ben"
hry2fer,2022-01-09 15:34:04,Nice punt
hry2f8i,2022-01-09 15:34:03,"To be fair Ray Ray McCloud is basically Randy Moss, you gotta give it a shot. 

I just want TJ to get the record and get us out of this season so we can move on with our lives with a new QB. Sick of watching this shit."
hry2cri,2022-01-09 15:33:39,"I can‚Äôt stand Ray Ray, but that floater was painful to watch"
hry2cqw,2022-01-09 15:33:39,ben dont wanna make the playoffs he ready for the couch
hry2cqt,2022-01-09 15:33:39,"Bottom 2 offense, not 2"
hry2cpv,2022-01-09 15:33:39,The old throw it up and let the great ray ray McCloud make a play.
hry2cjb,2022-01-09 15:33:37,Haven't seen an arm punt in a while
hry2c91,2022-01-09 15:33:34,Lol that's all he can do st this point of the season.
hry2c6i,2022-01-09 15:33:33,"Ray Ray is not the guy

Edit. And that was an atrocious decision. What the fuck"
hry2c4z,2022-01-09 15:33:33,Nice punt Ben.
hry2c4i,2022-01-09 15:33:33,That interception was in slow motion.
hry2byl,2022-01-09 15:33:31,That was horrible haha
hry2bxu,2022-01-09 15:33:31,Classic 2021 Steelers football baby
hry2bvw,2022-01-09 15:33:30,I have zero hopes for a competitive game if this team makes the playoffs lol
hry2bsg,2022-01-09 15:33:29,Just bad pass and bad decision Ben....
hry2bsf,2022-01-09 15:33:29,That was fucking stupid
hry2brs,2022-01-09 15:33:29,Wtf was that Ben
hry2br0,2022-01-09 15:33:29,It was as good as we could have expected the punt to be a few plays later.
hry2bqg,2022-01-09 15:33:29,As soon as he threw it I knew it was gonna be a pick‚Ä¶
hry2bqb,2022-01-09 15:33:29,Awful throw. Time to take Old Yeller out back.
hry2bq3,2022-01-09 15:33:29,"Ben..wtf, why? That had INT written all over it, throwing like that‚Ä¶"
hry2bp3,2022-01-09 15:33:28,What the fuck was that throw man
hry2bor,2022-01-09 15:33:28,God Ben looks bad
hry2bn1,2022-01-09 15:33:28,Please play Washington more than McCloud. This is ridiculous that he‚Äôs not getting the ball.
hry2bmz,2022-01-09 15:33:28,What a horrible decision
hry2bmu,2022-01-09 15:33:28,That‚Äôs ray-ray Ben not claypool. At least claypool could have knocked it out of play
hry2bgs,2022-01-09 15:33:26,It would be fitting if the Steelers snuck in and won the Super Bowl. It would be a fitting full circle ending to Ben's career.
hry2bey,2022-01-09 15:33:26,"It‚Äôs almost as if McCloud shouldn‚Äôt be on the field, let alone the team, let alone the league."
hry2bab,2022-01-09 15:33:24,The good old fuck it diontae down there somewhere
hry2b68,2022-01-09 15:33:23,Cmon Ben.... That's a rookie throw in your final game
hry2b4n,2022-01-09 15:33:23,had muth open goddamit ben
hry2ayu,2022-01-09 15:33:21,Terrible decision by Ben
hry2ayn,2022-01-09 15:33:21,If Ray Ray had been running rather than waiting...
hry2ay3,2022-01-09 15:33:21,Looks like the TEs will be the difference today.
hry2atf,2022-01-09 15:33:20,IS THIS HOW YOU WANNA GO OUT BEN?
hry2anm,2022-01-09 15:33:18,Not a great throw but it looks like he stopped his route short.
hry2agm,2022-01-09 15:33:17,Ben said fuck it
hry2ac1,2022-01-09 15:33:16,"God Ben, what are you doing?"
hry2aa2,2022-01-09 15:33:15,Come on Ben. Just floated it to em
hry2a4c,2022-01-09 15:33:13,Yeah man who could've seen Kalen Ballage forgetting he's supposed to be Ben's checkdown?
hry2a2m,2022-01-09 15:33:13,"no flow with this offense at all man, like cmon"
hry2a1v,2022-01-09 15:33:13,Tf

hry29v0,2022-01-09 15:33:11,"WTF was that...

RB just sat there blocking nobody with an open side of the field Ben looks RB is dumb and then Ben does that shit"
hry29u7,2022-01-09 15:33:11,Ah shit my stream is behind
hry29tw,2022-01-09 15:33:11,Forcing a terrible throw down field. Ben wtf man.
hry29rm,2022-01-09 15:33:10,Lol to the people that still think Ben is good for the team
hry29lx,2022-01-09 15:33:09,I thought Ben was done floating passes down the field into double coverage
hry29jj,2022-01-09 15:33:08,What was he trying to do on that throw lol
hry29c4,2022-01-09 15:33:06,Well that was a horrible play and pass
hry295r,2022-01-09 15:33:04,"Forcing the ball to Ray Ray McCloud. Yeah, that makes sense."
hry2944,2022-01-09 15:33:04,"hysterical. double coverage overthrow instead of throwing it to the sidelines. that damn todd haley, I mean fichtner, oh I mean canada"
hry292d,2022-01-09 15:33:04,It's really time for Ben unfortunately.

But I wake up to see an interception on the Ravens and the Jags are up on the Colts!

Dogs are in their jerseys, I've got my Hodges jersey on, Steelers socks are on, towel is in hand, and got some good weed ground up for the morning.

Let's fucking go!"
hry24d8,2022-01-09 15:32:18,"I just want someone to explain the rule to me and why it exists. If he fumbles he can still throw the ball. He's not outside the tackles running towards the line; he's standing up looking downfield. 

If the scoring rule was followed correctly, I want to know why it exists and what it adds to the sport. 

They need to go line by line and audit the rules; there is so much stupid useless shit lol"
hry23l6,2022-01-09 15:32:10,I was thinking the exact same thing big boy don't worry.

hry1ppi,2022-01-09 15:29:54,"Yeah, he's been playing hurt all season. Also it looks like we're playing more nickel and dime this game, which is pretty much determined by what offensive packages the Rat Birds send in."
hry1mjx,2022-01-09 15:29:22,He was touched down tho when he had control so play should be dead before the drop
hry1mg7,2022-01-09 15:29:21,I'm happy to be wrong
hry1m0h,2022-01-09 15:29:17,"He didn't, he sat two plays."
hry1lnl,2022-01-09 15:29:13,It‚Äôs an INT. He was down by contact. Whatever happened after Andrews touched him is irrelevant because the play is over
hry1lb0,2022-01-09 15:29:09,TJ's sack wasn't a sack based on the rules. We'll consider it the 20.5th sack as opposed to the Baker slide.
hry1kpi,2022-01-09 15:29:03,"I think so, especially after the last play his arm took a beating making that tackle attempt"
hry1kop,2022-01-09 15:29:03,Going between both games is hard work üòÇüòÇ
hry1kkf,2022-01-09 15:29:02,No volume on the TV at our gym. But thank you
hry1je0,2022-01-09 15:28:50,Has anyone every seen a mason jersey at a home game?
hry1g6a,2022-01-09 15:28:18,Clean pick and then touched.
hry1g4x,2022-01-09 15:28:18,"Anything AFTER that touch (when he starts losing the ball) shouldn't count, because you counted him down. So it should stand.

However, TJ's sack wasn't a sack so who fucking knows. üôÑ"
hry1g16,2022-01-09 15:28:17,Even ol brick hands catches one every once in awhile
hry1g11,2022-01-09 15:28:17,That is an interception.
hry1fxn,2022-01-09 15:28:16,"Ben definitely wanted him out, but someone was like ""We ain't got nobody else!""

He just said aww fuck and moved on LOL."
hry1fv9,2022-01-09 15:28:15,I've never actually seen a play like this
hry1frn,2022-01-09 15:28:14,Trevor Lawrence will save us! He should have his career breakout today
hry1fhq,2022-01-09 15:28:11,Andrews touches him down before the bobbling. He caught that with both of his wrists...
hry1fgx,2022-01-09 15:28:11,Did not look clean at all but I imagine he'd be down by contact as soon as he snagged the ball and before he dropped it so then its a pick? Otherwise if he wasn't touched that was dropped 100% imo
hry1fdn,2022-01-09 15:28:10,"Pardon my ignorance, but why does Watt spend so much time on the sideline? Are they limiting his snaps for an injury concern? Just resting so he doesn‚Äôt get gassed?"
hry1fcf,2022-01-09 15:28:10,HOLY SHIT
hry1fap,2022-01-09 15:28:10,Incomplete is not an option.
hry1f77,2022-01-09 15:28:09,The ravens need another team besides the jags to win aswell but I don't remember which
hry1euk,2022-01-09 15:28:05,Interception!!
hry1ete,2022-01-09 15:28:05,GOOD SHIT EDMUNDS
hry1elv,2022-01-09 15:28:03,"Andrews touched him down before he dropped it, our ball."
hry1eld,2022-01-09 15:28:03,Thanks Mandrews
hry1egi,2022-01-09 15:28:01,Holy fuck that was the best play of Edmunds career
hry1eez,2022-01-09 15:28:01,"He was touched, this might actually stand"
hry1e61,2022-01-09 15:27:59,Jags just stopped the colts on 4th. Come on Trevor!!!
hry1dye,2022-01-09 15:27:57,Jags moving down the field again
hry1dwq,2022-01-09 15:27:56,Damn Andrews touching him is rotten luck for them
hry1dw2,2022-01-09 15:27:56,Thats a pretty normal thing for a team to do
hry1dtd,2022-01-09 15:27:55,I think this might stand?
hry1doh,2022-01-09 15:27:54,Downed by contact. Pitt ball
hry1dkx,2022-01-09 15:27:53,Anything on that neck tackle in the return?
hry1dcz,2022-01-09 15:27:51,Why did TJ sit that series?
hry1d8x,2022-01-09 15:27:50,Hilarious. Touched him at the exact right time!
hry1d8s,2022-01-09 15:27:50,HOLY SHIT BOYS
hry1d0n,2022-01-09 15:27:47,Edmunds is not good at football
hry1cwt,2022-01-09 15:27:46,Bush knocked it out ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
hry1cq5,2022-01-09 15:27:45,They‚Äôre doubling him because  he‚Äôs the DPOY lol
hry1cji,2022-01-09 15:27:43,no chance in hippie hell thats a pick lol.
hry1cj4,2022-01-09 15:27:43,Edmunds looked like he held on long enough & then was touched by Andrews
hry1ch5,2022-01-09 15:27:43,Why was TJ on the sideline
hry19ac,2022-01-09 15:27:13,WOOOOOOOO LAD
hry18jw,2022-01-09 15:27:06,That‚Äôs a pick!!!
hry18cg,2022-01-09 15:27:04,That looked clean.
hry17s2,2022-01-09 15:26:58,Nope
hry173z,2022-01-09 15:26:52,Nope.  :(
hry15zs,2022-01-09 15:26:41,He got that
hry12nx,2022-01-09 15:26:08,True. Dumb.
hry12cu,2022-01-09 15:26:05,üëå
hry12bl,2022-01-09 15:26:05,"Didn't he drop that?

That's a good catch, he had it secured"
hry123n,2022-01-09 15:26:03,"Come on, Jags!"
hry10hd,2022-01-09 15:25:48,Hayward looks like a big great white out there
hry10gu,2022-01-09 15:25:48,Loudermilk is eating
hry10at,2022-01-09 15:25:46,Love Watt celebrating a 10th sack on the season for Heyward while on the sideline!
hry0zzq,2022-01-09 15:25:43,That‚Äôs not a sack either right? That‚Äôs an aborted play.
hry0z6a,2022-01-09 15:25:36,He definitely falls into the diva category. But his gameplay hasn‚Äôt really backed it up this season.
hry0yxy,2022-01-09 15:25:34,That should have been watts sack.
hry0vur,2022-01-09 15:25:05,JAGS 4th down stop! Let‚Äôs go!
hry0v61,2022-01-09 15:24:58,Jets fan rooting for y‚Äôall jags stopped titans on fourth and 2
hry0v51,2022-01-09 15:24:58,Jaguars with a huge stop on 4th down
hry0ug5,2022-01-09 15:24:52,"If you weren‚Äôt an NFL fan you‚Äôd think we were the ones with the decimated secondary, not the ravens"
hry0u7o,2022-01-09 15:24:49,edmunds cut his dreads?
hry0u2z,2022-01-09 15:24:48,Ok weird rules are weird haha
hry0u04,2022-01-09 15:24:47,"It's a dirty little secret that the Ravens stats guys used to pad Ray Lewis' stats during every home game. 

Now they're not giving TJ a sack there? Bullshit.

I hope their franchise disbands. I hope Bisciotti goes bankrupt in hilariously embarrassing fashion. Fuck 'em."
hry0tpg,2022-01-09 15:24:44,9 minutes in and I already know this week‚Äôs Days of our Steelers will cause indigestion.
hry0tgf,2022-01-09 15:24:42,DUVAL stop!
hry0slq,2022-01-09 15:24:34,Indy gets a turnover on downs
hry0od8,2022-01-09 15:23:53,Good point.  We've seen that song and dance far too many times this season.
hry0o34,2022-01-09 15:23:50,And questionable spot on DJ's play
hry0nec,2022-01-09 15:23:43,Actually not a bad idea. Wonder if we see he and highsmith rotate a bit
hry0mjc,2022-01-09 15:23:34,WATTMANIA LETS GO
hry0iil,2022-01-09 15:22:54,He doesn't know how to attack anyone past 3 yards of the line.
hry0igh,2022-01-09 15:22:53,Does Harris have a broken arm?
hry0icw,2022-01-09 15:22:52,More opportunities for sack now.
hry0i6j,2022-01-09 15:22:50,Not so sure that false start didn't save us 3 points. They were probably gonna stuff us.
hry0i4z,2022-01-09 15:22:50,"not on a fumble if they dont try to throw it after recovery, they are treated as a runner"
hry0hv6,2022-01-09 15:22:47,Yeah figured they would cause broken play.  Not surprised they did
hry0hof,2022-01-09 15:22:45,How is that a give up play? If Watt isn't there ti finish it then the ball isn't out. I'm confused.
hry0gjx,2022-01-09 15:22:35,https://twitter.com/PFF_Steelers/status/1480241648701423618?t=N6mXpk-jgDOkMY7i56PeoQ&s=19

hry0frz,2022-01-09 15:22:27,Yep
hry0fok,2022-01-09 15:22:26,So did they not give Watt the sack???
hry0fie,2022-01-09 15:22:24,Any chance that sack gets changed later? Seemed like he clearly controlled the ball after picking it up to me.
hry0f7z,2022-01-09 15:22:21,bro shut up
hry0bg6,2022-01-09 15:21:45,Put his arm down during a 3rd down tackle and it twisted his elbow/forearm pretty nasty. He was in pretty big pain but jumped off the field. Status is still unknown but they were putting a sleeve on him at one point.
hry0bej,2022-01-09 15:21:44,Guys maybe chill on Benny I‚Äôm not thrilled about that either but under normal circumstances he would have never been in that position anyways
hry0ba5,2022-01-09 15:21:43,Thanks!!
hry0ayi,2022-01-09 15:21:40,And it's only been 20 minutes. Heard the QB is leaving the team after the game too
hry0afq,2022-01-09 15:21:35,"They're convenient for pulling up/down. Additionally, in the cold, they provide a lot of warmth. I wore them at work even before COVID just for that reason."

hry09nx,2022-01-09 15:21:27,"Haha literally strips Huntley. That's some Bs. I'm fine with no sack, but he definitely stripped him"
hry09lk,2022-01-09 15:21:26,They changed it to an aborted snap so it wasn‚Äôt considered a dropback.
hry09j2,2022-01-09 15:21:26,Before wentz has even been on the field lol
hry09es,2022-01-09 15:21:24,Alright let's just stop all the games right now. I see no need to continue
hry09bf,2022-01-09 15:21:24,lol its a long game.  dont get too excited yet

hry08mo,2022-01-09 15:21:17,Bc it's Benny Snell
hry08kx,2022-01-09 15:21:16,Ok. Time for tj to get another sack. (First one counts to me Idc what the NFL says)
hry08d7,2022-01-09 15:21:14,"Jags up 7-0, we‚Äôre up 3-0

*don‚Äôt get your hopes up don‚Äôt get your hopes up*"
hry08ao,2022-01-09 15:21:13,Cracked ribs.  He and TJ will just swap rib protectors every switch of possession.

hry07sy,2022-01-09 15:21:09,Been running better than Harris was before he got injured.
hry0546,2022-01-09 15:20:43,How does a running back get a false start?
hry050z,2022-01-09 15:20:42,For whom
hry04wp,2022-01-09 15:20:41,They said no he never had possession
hry04rr,2022-01-09 15:20:39,A guy landed on his arm.
hry04ml,2022-01-09 15:20:38,Campbell the Giant probably would've stopped Snell again anyway
hry04hc,2022-01-09 15:20:37,Jacksonville is winning i can‚Äôt this is so funny
hry041t,2022-01-09 15:20:32,They‚Äôre calling it an ‚Äúaborted play‚Äù
hry03xa,2022-01-09 15:20:31,We might get in but we're broken
hry03ki,2022-01-09 15:20:27,False start on 4th & inches. That's a penalty that tends to change the outcome of games.
hry03d5,2022-01-09 15:20:25,They say no. I wonder if that can be later corrected though.
hry03co,2022-01-09 15:20:25,Whoops
hry031a,2022-01-09 15:20:22,I want a BIG BEN running TD today
hry0315,2022-01-09 15:20:22,I would love to see how many pre snap penalties we have on 3 and 4th down. It‚Äôs gotta be ridiculously high.
hry0307,2022-01-09 15:20:22,All that stupid fucking motion...qb keeper gets that every time
hry02ms,2022-01-09 15:20:18,I guess because he already fumbled and picked it back up
hry02fv,2022-01-09 15:20:16,Is Tomlin always wearing a gaiter because he's not vacc'd or something?
hry02an,2022-01-09 15:20:15,Me too take them points!!
hry01zq,2022-01-09 15:20:12,My only hope for 22-23 season is we start converting TDs not FGs in the redzone.
hry01s6,2022-01-09 15:20:10,False start as a RB. Can't make this shit up. Bench him already.
hry01pa,2022-01-09 15:20:09,Go jags baby
hry01m5,2022-01-09 15:20:08,Son of a bastard.

hrxzx7g,2022-01-09 15:19:26,Right you are Ken.  Still plenty of time to get a couple more.

hrxzrdn,2022-01-09 15:18:28,"I think najee will be ok. The way they were talking it wasn‚Äôt too bad. Diontae on the other hand, that might be some cracked/broken ribs"
hrxzr3f,2022-01-09 15:18:25,I mean if Favre can lie on the ground to give Strahan a sack how is Huntley having full possession of the ball and trying to scramble not a sack?
hrxzqdp,2022-01-09 15:18:18,Aborted play? That‚Äôs a sack. Huntley grabbed the ball.
hrxzqc7,2022-01-09 15:18:18,"If it was an aborted play, he would have been down when he covered the ball. He was trying to get back up and was sacked and fumbled.  Fucking horseshit."
hrxzq9i,2022-01-09 15:18:17,"Yeah, we need to win this game."
hrxzq8f,2022-01-09 15:18:17,Home of Challenge Pissing!

hrxzc2x,2022-01-09 15:15:59,No sack for TJ
hrxzbnv,2022-01-09 15:15:55,SCORE!

hrxzbeu,2022-01-09 15:15:53,scored
hrxzavf,2022-01-09 15:15:48,Harris now diontae
hrxz6zv,2022-01-09 15:15:11,I think it's alot on the center. Green would make plays dead in the water by losing ground.
hrxz6xi,2022-01-09 15:15:10,Bastards.
hrxz6ui,2022-01-09 15:15:09,No sack for TJ
hrxz6t6,2022-01-09 15:15:09,DUVAL!
hrxz6p8,2022-01-09 15:15:08,Ran into the only tree in the forest
hrxz6jw,2022-01-09 15:15:06,The best ratbird game ever was still when they were standing around the field no one paying attention as the clock ran out
hrxz5vw,2022-01-09 15:15:00,I think it‚Äôs the center personally.
hrxz5v8,2022-01-09 15:14:59,Claypool ran too far upfield for a Canada 3 yard pass
hrxz5eu,2022-01-09 15:14:55,Jaguars knocking on the door of the goal line.
hrxz56u,2022-01-09 15:14:52,Lol Claypool gave thay guy a hi-five.
hrxz497,2022-01-09 15:14:43,Not a sack? Morons
hrxz3z5,2022-01-09 15:14:40,Consensus from who?
hrxz3i3,2022-01-09 15:14:35,Najee did not look good on the sideline
hrxz0sz,2022-01-09 15:14:09,Let's go Benny earn some snaps next year.
hrxz0fb,2022-01-09 15:14:05,"Ok, seriously, is it: the center, the o-line coach or the defenses?

Our run game has looked way different the past two weeks."
hrxz0c2,2022-01-09 15:14:04,SOUNDS LIKE A HOME GAME!
hrxz05x,2022-01-09 15:14:02,How is it not a sack?
hrxyzh6,2022-01-09 15:13:55,Nasty stinger Najee got. We all done that before playing sports. Hopefully isn‚Äôt too shaken up.
hrxyzcz,2022-01-09 15:13:54,"My man Leglue out there bleeding on the left shoulder, doesn't give a shit."
hrxyz88,2022-01-09 15:13:53,Are they not crediting TJ with that strip sack?
hrxyz7o,2022-01-09 15:13:53,The ravens didn‚Äôt fall for the snell handoffs last time. This time they don‚Äôt have a chance lol
hrxyyr9,2022-01-09 15:13:48,Snell running on fresh legs.
hrxyxf8,2022-01-09 15:13:35,"I‚Äôve done it, you‚Äôre fine in the stadium it‚Äôs walking back to your car that‚Äôs the issue."
hrxytrh,2022-01-09 15:12:59,That's a sack. Huntley picked it back up before getting hit.
hrxyto3,2022-01-09 15:12:58,The ballsack strip sack!
hrxytie,2022-01-09 15:12:56,Bens gonna have to throw 500 times in the rain on his last game. Snell only took 60 seconds to get to the outside there.
hrxythf,2022-01-09 15:12:56,15 games
hrxyt5j,2022-01-09 15:12:53,Zaaaaaaaach
hrxysyn,2022-01-09 15:12:51,That‚Äôs the defensive player of the year üòå
hrxysfs,2022-01-09 15:12:45,"This is the way it is scored right now: 

>Steelers (10:03) (Shotgun) T.Huntley Aborted. B.Bozeman FUMBLES at BLT 46, RECOVERED by PIT-H.Mondeaux at PIT 39.

Not a sack at the moment"
hrxys42,2022-01-09 15:12:42,ON WISCONSIN!
hrxys32,2022-01-09 15:12:42,This is the best case scenario for Najee.
hrxys1k,2022-01-09 15:12:41,I hope TJ goes off for like 4 more sacks to obliterate the record
hrxyrwc,2022-01-09 15:12:40,"Let‚Äôs go TJ. Tied the record guys a straight beast. My favorite Steeler, post Ben for sure."
hrxyrhx,2022-01-09 15:12:36,Would you wear Steelers colors in Baltimore? I wouldn‚Äôt.
hrxyrf8,2022-01-09 15:12:35,Reminds me of when I would hear Heath chants two years after he retired
hrxyrey,2022-01-09 15:12:35,Wtf Benny ‚ÄúEmmett smith‚Äù Snell
hrxyqo2,2022-01-09 15:12:27,Very low IQ play from Baltimore.  Just stay down son.
hrxyqkw,2022-01-09 15:12:27,2014 Bell memories. Will be ugly if they win and the jags also win
hrxyqfq,2022-01-09 15:12:25,I think Najee has some nerve damage.
hrxyqad,2022-01-09 15:12:24,Every time  Gentry gets the ball. He looks good.
hrxyq7f,2022-01-09 15:12:23,"Now get another, TJ."
hrxyq6q,2022-01-09 15:12:23,How the fuck would that not be a sack???
hrxynj3,2022-01-09 15:11:55,Watt is a phenom
hrxynin,2022-01-09 15:11:55,Wow they said it might not count
hrxyn9c,2022-01-09 15:11:52,not a sack i dont think. Never was an opportunity to pass
hrxyn6r,2022-01-09 15:11:51,Muth chant for Gentry lol
hrxymws,2022-01-09 15:11:49,That was fast.
hrxymq4,2022-01-09 15:11:47,TJ MOTHER FUCKING WATT
hrxymmf,2022-01-09 15:11:46,Bozeman hit himself square in the taint on that snap
hrxymhx,2022-01-09 15:11:44,"No idea why their QB decided to try to get up with the ball instead of covering it up and staying down, but I'm not complaining"
hrxyme2,2022-01-09 15:11:43,TJ MOTHERFUCKING WATT!!!!!!!
hrxymcp,2022-01-09 15:11:43,TJ is a bad mfer. He shares my bday. He's a Steeler. Why I don't have his jersey idk. I need to fix that.

hrxy1gl,2022-01-09 15:08:10,Yay another Matt Canada special. Hope Najee's alright.

hrxxphd,2022-01-09 15:06:07,Can someone give link?
hrxxorm,2022-01-09 15:06:00,Baltimore secondary in shambles. Two consecutive runs.

hrxxji4,2022-01-09 15:05:08,I bet it's cause of the double history being made. Tj sack record and Ben's last game
hrxxih3,2022-01-09 15:04:57,Fog. And rain.
hrxxi74,2022-01-09 15:04:55,I hope Ben slings a few passes. Nothing to lose.
hrxxi35,2022-01-09 15:04:53,Anyone else still have fantasy games? I have a chase Ben stack since burrow is out
hrxxhp5,2022-01-09 15:04:50,The Pittsburgh Steelers are my favorite football team.

hrxxaaw,2022-01-09 15:03:36,Nice return
hrxx0w9,2022-01-09 15:02:01,"As much as I think they're overrated, would've been nice to get the #1 team in Romo and Simms to show respect to Roethlisberger's last game. If this were Drew Brees or someone, they would've made sure they got the #1 team for a network."
hrxwz0f,2022-01-09 15:01:42,Now you're talking!

hrxw461,2022-01-09 14:56:23,"Cold and rainy in Baltimore. 

Sounds absolutely miserable"
hrxw1yw,2022-01-09 14:56:00,Love today's social justice hats today lok
hrxw1ty,2022-01-09 14:55:58,The good thing is we‚Äôll know in the next few hours if we‚Äôre making the playoffs or not
hrxvvoh,2022-01-09 14:54:56,Nothing like wrapping up Bens career being serenaded by Ian Eagle!
hrxvnxs,2022-01-09 14:53:39,Lets go Jags!!!
hrxvi8r,2022-01-09 14:52:41,"I feel so bad for him. It must suck to hop around to different teams, finally earn your spot, and then have it ruined by an injury."

hrxvbfa,2022-01-09 14:51:30,"I hope we get in but if not, I hope Ben fucks the Ravens one last time!!"
hrxv1mm,2022-01-09 14:49:48,Hell the bungles I would expect them to have Burfutt on the sideline to run out and do it
hrxv0hu,2022-01-09 14:49:37,Waitman has definitely been better but it‚Äôs a small sample. I also think losing your spot because of your Dad‚Äôs death is just bad. I‚Äôm willing to let things ride today and having an open battle in the off season.
hrxuvlt,2022-01-09 14:48:47,This pregame interview with Ben and Caher is making me even more emotional
hrxuush,2022-01-09 14:48:39,And it's ain't gonna be like Favre laying down for Strahan...TJ's gonna earn it
hrxum02,2022-01-09 14:47:07,"I‚Äôd expect that behavior from the Bungles, but not Baltimore"
hrxuiq6,2022-01-09 14:46:32,"Sack record will be shattered today. Not tied, but shattered."
hrxui3d,2022-01-09 14:46:26,Banner can‚Äôt even get the start? He‚Äôs as good as gone
hrxugzc,2022-01-09 14:46:15,Seems like a way to let Harvin prove himself. Open competition I say
hrxuabg,2022-01-09 14:45:08,Think bigger.
hrxt6w2,2022-01-09 14:38:31,"Yes, I for one was excited. To draft a guy  in the first round, and make them sit, Bill cowher always seem to do that."
hrxt0o2,2022-01-09 14:37:26,And it needs to be a 40 oz big Ben can
hrxsvy5,2022-01-09 14:36:39,I don't think anyone on the Ravens is that much of a piece of shit
hrxsn6c,2022-01-09 14:35:06,Maddox couldn't score. Ben came in and scored two TDs although he missed on the 2 pt conversion
hrxsi4k,2022-01-09 14:34:13,This guy......
hrxrxy0,2022-01-09 14:30:43,Everyone have their 7 Iron Citys for Ben's last ride?
