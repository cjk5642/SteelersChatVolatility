# SteelersChatVolatility

This project was aiming at understanding the live chat of a Steelers game that was constantly fluctuating from positive to negative in my subjective point of view. I scraped the data using PushShift's Reddit API and applied a quick sentiment analysis. Anyone wanting to analyze further is encouraged!

## The Game
On January 9, 2022, the Steelers faced the Ravens in Baltimore. Both teams were in playoff contention so the game was high-stakes. The data presented represents the last few minutes of the game of the Steelers subreddit where the users on Reddit were, in my opinion, very volatile in their reactions to the plays.
